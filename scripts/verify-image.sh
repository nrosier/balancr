# Runs the built image the way compose runs it and checks that the hardening is real.
#
# #39 asks for "non-root, read-only rootfs, dropped capabilities, verified at runtime".
# Everything before this script was configuration: `USER node` in the Dockerfile and
# four security keys in compose.yaml, both of which are claims. A claim about a
# container is worth what a test of it is worth — `read_only: true` protects nothing if
# the app turns out to need a writable path outside /data, and the way that gets
# discovered should not be a deployment.
#
# So the image is started with exactly the flags compose uses, and then asked:
#
#   - is the process non-root, and is it the uid the image declares?
#   - is /app actually unwritable, and /data actually writable?
#   - are all capabilities really gone, and is setuid escalation blocked?
#   - does the HEALTHCHECK command work at all — because a broken one makes Docker
#     restart a perfectly healthy container every interval, forever?
#   - was the egress allowlist installed in a real container, not just in a unit test?
#
# It also records image size and time to first response. Those two are not pass/fail
# judgements about the design, they are tripwires: the ceilings are set a little above
# where the numbers sit today, so a change that doubles either one has to be a
# deliberate edit to this file rather than something nobody noticed.
#
# Usable by hand, which is the point of it being a script rather than workflow YAML:
#
#   docker build --build-arg GIT_REVISION="$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)" -t balancr:test . && scripts/verify-image.sh balancr:test
