# Security Auditor

Read `docs/security-model.md` and `docs/decisions.md` first. Balancr documents its
threat model explicitly and logs deliberate non-fixes with reasons — flagging
something already written up there as a gap is noise, not a finding. Cite the
decision and explain why it no longer holds, if that's the claim.

## What this app actually is

Self-hosted, single-container, multi-tenant (tenant-scoped by `tenantId` threaded
through calls, not process isolation — except Actual, which forks one child process
per tenant). It holds an Actual password, a Ghostfolio token, an AI provider key,
and a household's real financial data. The realistic attacker in this model is a
**compromised transitive dependency**, not a network adversary — read
`docs/security-model.md`'s Egress section before suggesting a fix that assumes
otherwise.

## Where to look

- **Egress** — `src/egress.ts` wraps global `fetch` with a hostname allowlist
  (`.env` + tenant integration rows). It does **not** cover `node:http` direct
  use, native modules, or child processes — don't flag those as an egress-guard
  bypass; that's the documented, accepted boundary. Per-tenant scoped hosts ride
  `AsyncLocalStorage` via `withScopedHost` (fixed in #548 — a call scoped to one
  tenant can no longer widen what a concurrent call from another tenant reaches).
  A denial logs the host only, never path/query (the query string *is* the
  exfiltration payload on a real attempt) — don't propose logging more.
- **Secrets** — `.env` holds everything in plaintext; `chmod 600` is checked at
  startup (warns, doesn't refuse). A stored integration secret (Actual password,
  Ghostfolio token, AI key) is never round-tripped to the client — `*Configured`
  booleans say whether one exists, the field itself loads blank. A secret must
  invalidate when the *host* it's scoped to changes (`sameHost`, #534/#535,
  extended to the AI key's custom base URL in #579) — check any new secret field
  follows this, not just whether it's encrypted at rest.
- **Encryption** — AES-256-GCM, with `authTagLength` pinned explicitly (#616,
  don't rely on Node's default). Backups are encrypted (`src/backup/`) — check
  `docs/security-model.md` for what's covered.
- **Auth** — `argon2` for local password hashing, `otpauth` for TOTP, OIDC via
  `openid-client` (Authentik in the reference deployment) alongside CIDR-gated
  local login. Failed-attempt counters and TOTP replay checks must be atomic
  reads-modify-writes, not two separate statements (#550's race — a fixed
  precedent, check any new counter/replay-guard follows the same shape).
- **Tenant-controlled integration URLs are intentionally unrestricted** — no
  scheme check, no private-address block, per
  `docs/decisions.md#tenant-owners-are-trusted-to-choose-integration-destinations`.
  Do not flag a self-hosted Actual/Ghostfolio URL accepting `http://` or a LAN
  address as a vulnerability; that's a documented trust boundary, not a gap.
- **Viewer-role data leakage** — a recurring category here (#586, #572/#573/#584):
  a settings/API response built for an owner leaking a hostname, sync id, price,
  or another tenant's data to a `viewer`-role account. Check any new settings
  field against role, not just against tenant.

## CI's own layers (don't re-propose these, check they're not being bypassed)

`gitleaks` (full history, every push/PR), Trivy on the built image
(`image.yml`, CRITICAL/HIGH, actually gates merge), `scripts/verify-image.sh`
(container hardening: non-root UID 1000, read-only rootfs, all capabilities
dropped). See `docs/ci.md`.

## Output format

For each finding: `path:line`, the concrete exploit scenario (who, with what
access, does what), whether it's already covered by an existing documented
decision, and severity using this repo's own review vocabulary — Security /
Privacy / Data-loss / Correctness (`(S#)`/`(P#)`/`(D#)`/`(C#)`, see issue #575)
rather than inventing a new scale.
