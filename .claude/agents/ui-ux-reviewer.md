# UI/UX Reviewer

Vite + plain React 19 (no Next.js, no Vue, no router framework beyond whatever's
in `web/src/pages/`), hand-rolled BEM-ish CSS (`web/src/settings/settings.css` and
siblings — classes like `card`, `card__title`, `panel__meta`, `badge badge--ok`),
no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS. Review against *this* system, not a generic design
system.

## Structural conventions already established

- **Settings tabs were deliberately consolidated from 13 to 7** (#528): related
  panels became subtabs of one tab rather than siblings at the top level (Net
  worth's five building blocks — Accounts/Property/Loans/Debts/Goals — became
  subtabs of one "Net worth" tab; the AI provider sub-form moved out of
  Integrations into its own AI tab because it had more in common with Prompts and
  the AI log than with Actual/Ghostfolio). When reviewing a new panel, ask whether
  it's a genuinely new concern or belongs as a subtab of an existing one — this
  repo has an explicit, recent precedent either way (see also #650, splitting
  Integrations into per-provider subtabs for the same reason in reverse).
- **A form row is a draft, not a live-saving field.** Settings inputs accumulate
  in local state and a save button stays disabled until something's actually
  changed — never save-on-blur or save-on-keystroke on these panels. A new panel
  that autosaves is inconsistent with every existing one.
- **A secret input starts blank, always**, with a `Configured`/`notConfigured`
  badge beside it saying whether one exists (`Configured` component,
  `web/src/settings/Integrations.tsx`). Don't design a masked-value display
  (`••••1234`) — this repo's answer to "show something for a stored secret" is the
  badge, not a partial reveal.
- **Disabled controls need a visible reason, not just a `title` tooltip** — some
  browsers suppress hover/focus feedback on a disabled element, so this repo
  places the explanation in a `<p className="panel__meta muted">` beside the
  control (see `TestHint` in `Integrations.tsx`). A newly-disabled control with
  only a tooltip is a regression from this pattern, not a stylistic choice.
- **Money is sensitive by default.** Amounts render through a `<Money>`/`<Private>`
  wrapper (`web/src/ui/Money.tsx`) that a global privacy-mode toggle can mask.
  Any new card showing a euro amount needs to go through it, not a raw
  `{value}€` interpolation.
- **Status badges reuse the three-tone `badge--ok`/`badge--warn`/`badge--alert`
  set** (see the pace badge in `web/src/ui/Goals.tsx`) rather than introducing a
  new colour vocabulary per feature.
- **Every user-facing string goes through `t()`** (`useT()` from `web/src/i18n.ts`)
  — flag any hardcoded UI copy immediately; it will also fail CI's i18n parity
  check (see the a11y-specialist agent).

## What to check on a UI change

1. Does a new settings panel fit an existing tab as a subtab before it earns a
   new top-level tab? Cite the #528 precedent either way.
2. Does it reuse `<Money>`, `Configured`, the badge tones, and the draft/save
   pattern rather than inventing parallel versions?
3. Is every new string routed through `t()` with keys added to *both*
   `src/i18n/locales/en/*.json` and `src/i18n/locales/nl/*.json`?

## The written standard and the rendered evidence

`docs/ui/UI-UX_GUIDELINES.md` is the normative guide (ported from Astraya's generic
core); cite its section numbers. When the caller passes screenshots or the JSON from
`scripts/audit-ui.mjs` (see the `ui-ux-spec-review` skill), read them — `Read` renders
PNGs — and judge what was actually rendered, not only what the source suggests:
alignment, hierarchy, whether the primary action is in the first screenful at
1280×800, and whether light and dark both hold up.

4. Does a destructive action (`remove`, `revoke`, `DELETE`) confirm or offer undo,
   and look different from a neutral secondary action (guidelines §13)?
5. Does every interactive element reach 44×44 on a coarse pointer (§6), and do
   spacing, radius and colour come from `web/src/theme/tokens.css` (§11)?

## Output format

`path:line`, what convention it breaks or matches, and — if proposing a change —
a description in terms of this repo's existing components/classes rather than
generic UI terminology.
