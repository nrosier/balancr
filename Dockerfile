# Chainguard's Wolfi-based node image, not Alpine. Wolfi is glibc, not musl,
# so this rebuilds native deps (better-sqlite3, argon2) on a glibc base end
# to end rather than mixing an Alpine builder with a glibc runtime, which
# would ship musl-linked .node binaries into a glibc image.
#
# Chainguard's default `node` tag ships no shell/apk (only enough busybox for
# COPY-time RUN like mkdir); `node:latest-dev` adds apk + a build toolchain.
# Free-tier Chainguard only tracks `latest`/`latest-dev`, not pinned point
# releases, so there is no equivalent of Dockerfile.alpine's
# ARG NODE_VERSION=26.8.2-alpine pin here.
#
# Both stages below are pinned to the digest `latest-dev`/`latest` resolved
# to on 2026-09-21 (`docker buildx imagetools inspect cgr.dev/chainguard/node:latest-dev`),
# rather than the floating tag, so a rebuild doesn't silently pick up a new
# base image. Renovate (renovate.json) refreshes the pin itself on every run
# regardless of the `pinDigests: false` packageRule there — that rule only
# stops it converting a bare floating *tag* into a pinned digest; it says
# nothing about keeping an existing tag+digest pin current, which is what
# every FROM here already is and what gets refreshed below.
#
# The tag stays in the reference (`:latest-dev@sha256:...`, not bare
# `@sha256:...`) so Renovate can tell these two stages apart from the
# `runtime` stage below: with no tag, a bare `image@sha256:...` reference is
# ambiguous about which of Chainguard's tags it was resolved from, and
# Renovate silently treated all three FROM lines as tracking `latest` — the
# no-apk image — clobbering these two dev pins with that digest instead of
# `latest-dev`'s (#462's break).
#
# amd64 only, matching Dockerfile.alpine's current scope. Dockerfile.alpine
# is kept as a reference/fallback build; CI no longer builds it.
