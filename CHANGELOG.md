# Changelog

All notable changes to Balancr, newest first. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow the
scheme in [README](README.md#versioning) — a minor lands when its milestone is
complete, patches carry the work in between, and 1.0.0 ships when testing says so
rather than when the feature list ends.

## [2.5.5] — 2026-11-02

Dependency and base-image maintenance — no user-facing behavior change.

### Security

- **`handlebars`, pulled in only through `@actual-app/core`, carried three advisories (GHSA-8r5x-fm3f-whwj, CVE-2026-106445, CVE-2026-106446) in the affected range `3.0.0`–`4.7.9`**
  ([#831](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/831)). It is now pinned to `4.7.10` with an override scoped to `@actual-app/core`, its only dependent, so the audit no longer flags it.
- **Routine security-advisory bumps**: `nodemailer` ([#810](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/810), [#814](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/814)), `fastify` ([#813](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/813), [#835](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/835)), and `vite` ([#812](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/812)).
- **The production image's Chainguard `node` runtime digest moves to the current build** ([#806](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/806)), and the dev-stage digest used only to build moves with it ([#807](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/807), [#833](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/833)).

### Changed

- **`@actual-app/api` and `@actual-app/core` both move to `26.11.0`** ([#826](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/826), [#827](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/827)). The manually pinned `EXPECTED_API_VERSION` guard in `src/adapters/actual/protocol.ts` moves with it.
- **The declared Node engine moves to `>=26.13.0`**, matching `.nvmrc` and the Node 26 pins ([#825](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/825), [#830](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/830)).
- **Routine dependency maintenance**: `@google/genai` ([#809](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/809)), `@fastify/cookie`, `@fastify/helmet`, `@fastify/rate-limit`, `@fastify/static` ([#818](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/818), [#819](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/819), [#820](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/820), [#828](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/828)), `drizzle-orm` ([#821](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/821)), `openid-client` ([#822](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/822)), `pino` ([#823](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/823)), `i18next` ([#829](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/829)), `otpauth` ([#836](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/836)), dev dependencies ([#808](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/808), [#834](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/834)), and a lock-file maintenance pass ([#811](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/811), [#837](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/837)), each verified by CI before merging.

## [2.5.4] — 2026-10-02

Dependency and base-image maintenance — no user-facing behavior change.

### Security

- **The production image's Chainguard `node` base carried a HIGH-severity Trivy finding in Wolfi's bundled `npm` package (CVE-2026-102276, CVE-2026-102278)**
  ([#798](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/798)). The runtime image digest is bumped to the current `cgr.dev/chainguard/node:latest` build, which carries the patched package; the dev-stage image digest used only to build moves too
  ([#648](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/648)).

### Changed

- **Routine dependency maintenance**: `@fastify/static` ([#649](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/649)), `@types/node` ([#576](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/576)), `nodemailer` ([#799](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/799)), `@google/genai` ([#801](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/801) — now with an `allowScripts` entry so its install script passes the allowlist gate), dev dependencies including `typescript-eslint` ([#800](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/800)), and a lock-file maintenance pass ([#710](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/710)) — each verified by CI before merging.
- **`@actual-app/api` and `@actual-app/core` both move to `26.10.0`**
  ([#802](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/802), [#803](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/803)). The manually pinned `EXPECTED_API_VERSION` guard in `src/adapters/actual/protocol.ts` moves with it, and resolving the two PRs together also deduped a nested `@actual-app/core` copy out of the lockfile.

## [2.5.3] — 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **Every sync job failed outright with "method not allowed: getTags", leaving all cached figures stale across every household**
  ([#797](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/797), [#796](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/796)). The `/tags` page shipped in 2.5.2 added `fetchTags()`, which calls `actual.getTags()` through the per-tenant Actual worker, but the worker's `ALLOWED_METHODS` allowlist — the actual enforcement point for what may cross IPC to `@actual-app/api` — was never updated to include it, so the rejection happened before the call ever reached the Actual server and took down the whole sync job, not just tag totals. `getTags` is now allowlisted alongside `getSchedules`/`getRules`, same read-only, always-a-lone-call justification.

## [2.5.2] — 2026-09-29

### Security

- **A newly created user defaulted to the `owner` role instead of `viewer`, and disabling a user left its existing sessions alive**
  ([#697](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/697), [#695](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/695)). `users.role` now defaults to `viewer` (existing rows migrate via `0050`), and disabling a user now also ends its sessions.
- **A backup's intermediate plaintext database copy was left group/world-readable for the duration of `VACUUM INTO`**
  ([#698](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/698)). It's now `chmod 0600` immediately after the copy completes.
- **`/auth/session` and every other `/api/*` response could be cached by the browser, letting a prior account's identity leak on a shared device**
  ([#730](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/730), [#696](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/696)). Responses now carry `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Vary: Cookie`.
- **`reconstructFindings` read `ai_findings` by `run_id` with no tenant filter**
  ([#734](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/734)), a tenant-isolation gap now closed.
- **AI spend and sync errors were visible to a viewer, with no owner-only way to manage who has access**
  ([#728](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/728), [#729](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/729), [#739](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/739)). Both are now masked from viewer-role responses, behind a new owner-only user-access panel.

### Added

- **A property's rent or mortgage payment can now link directly to the Actual schedule that represents it**, not just its category
  ([#662](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/662)). The schedule's own resolved category and amount supersede the manually set ones once linked; a household that never adopts this sees no change.
- **Per-tag net cost/gain totals**, with a new minimal `/tags` page
  ([#663](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/663)). Off-budget accounts are included, matching how a tag can span the on-budget/off-budget boundary a category can't; totals are cached at sync time like every other computed figure.
- **A reconciliation check now warns when a self-reported property, loan or debt looks like the same money as an off-budget Actual account**
  ([#689](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/689)), without ever merging or excluding anything automatically.

### Changed

- **Property cards get a heading and their mortgage sub-blocks are visually separated**
  ([#661](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/661)), with aligned field captions and mortgage actions pulled into their own row.
- **A redundant `modelPrices` viewer-mask was dropped**
  ([#735](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/735)) — `GET /api/ai/estimate` and the AI run log already expose the same pricing on purpose.

### Fixed

- **Several tag-total bugs**: a tag deleted in Actual left a decaying ghost row in `tag_meta` ([#733](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/733), [#751](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/751)); a tag's net total depended on which leg of a boundary-crossing transfer carried it ([#690](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/690)); totals kept Actual's signed convention instead of the app's own positive-out convention ([#753](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/753)); and tag windows anchored on wall-clock "now" instead of `latestStoredMonth` like every other surface ([#752](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/752)). `fetchTagMonthlyTotals` and `loadTagTotals` now aggregate in SQL instead of one query per tag or a full in-JS scan ([#691](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/691), [#692](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/692)).
- **The `/tags` table had no defined row order, couldn't wrap a long tag name, and Privacy mode's `tabIndex` on `<Money>` added 120 unnamed tab stops to a 40-row table**
  ([#771](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/771), [#772](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/772), [#778](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/778)); the page also gained a `NotConfigured` gate matching other setup-dependent pages ([#783](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/783)).
- **Several disabled controls gave no visible or announced reason**: row-cap "Add" buttons ([#670](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/670), [#768](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/768)), the "Use standard payment" button ([#706](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/706)), and the AI settings Save button — whose budget field also couldn't parse a Belgian-locale number ([#784](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/784)).
- **Accessibility fixes across PeriodPicker and settings**: per-row disclosure buttons and disabled month/year cells had no distinguishing accessible name or announcement ([#668](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/668), [#669](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/669)); the mode toggle and dialog picked up further fixes ([#774](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/774)); a locale-formatting bug built its own `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instead of the shared one ([#773](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/773)); and disabled-cell contrast collapsed to 2.59:1 in light theme ([#781](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/781)).
- **Onboarding's mode picker used `tablist`/`tab` roles with no keyboard handling**
  ([#671](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/671)), and now follows the ARIA group/pressed pattern already used elsewhere (`ThemeToggle`).
- **Archived-goal text dropped below AA contrast under its own opacity, and per-account settings controls repeated identical labels with no row-group association**
  ([#775](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/775), [#779](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/779)); Benchmark and Risk tables gained the shared keyboard-scroll-region convention and a caption ([#780](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/780)).
- **Row-cap hints across Loans, Debts, Goals, Property, Benchmark and Digest settings panels now render only once the cap is reached, each linked to its Add button via `aria-describedby`**
  ([#786](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/786), [#787](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/787), [#788](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/788)); the nav tab-bar's label sizing was recalibrated for 8 tabs with a `title` fallback ([#769](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/769)), and pace-mark contrast was raised to 3:1 against every fill state ([#770](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/770)).
- **A `total`-kind goal's progress was priced against the wrong net-worth figure, and the forecast double-counted average spend on top of already-tagged fixed categories and bills**
  ([#684](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/684), [#685](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/685)); the emergency-fund cushion is now judged against the same EWMA convention `income_change` already uses and counts on-budget liquid money only ([#686](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/686), [#747](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/747)), Overview and Findings agree on one definition of "months of cover" ([#687](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/687)), and a category-kind goal's `elapsedMonths` is now correct across gaps in its trend ([#688](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/688)).
- **A category source-locale change wrote two tables without a transaction, and `setSourceOfTruth`/`saveParams`/`saveProfile` had the same read-modify-write gap**
  ([#732](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/732), [#678](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/678), [#680](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/680)); `resetComputedData` and `forgetMonth` now clear every affected table instead of a subset ([#677](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/677), [#679](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/679)).
- **Four tables existed as schema exports but were missing from the object handed to `drizzle()`, and the legacy single-mortgage read-time shim was replaced with a real one-time migration**
  ([#682](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/682), [#683](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/683)).
- **Validation gaps**: the AI budget field, a custom AI provider's blank base URL, onboarding's server-side field errors, and month-note's length rejection now all surface consistently on the client
  ([#672](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/672), [#674](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/674), [#675](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/675), [#676](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/676)); nested Zod paths (e.g. `properties.0.label`) now match their panel-level lookup key instead of only an exact string ([#673](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/673)), and that same matching logic — previously drifted across three separate copies — is now shared ([#790](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/790)). Every property/goal category-link field now has its own `<Issue>` rendering slot, with a compiler-enforced guard test keeping the list in sync ([#736](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/736)).
- **A further batch of fixes landed across budget, portfolio, and forecast surfaces**
  ([#731](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/731), [#744](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/744), [#745](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/745), [#746](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/746), [#748](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/748), [#749](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/749), [#750](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/750), [#756](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/756)).
- **An archived goal's target amount wasn't masked under privacy mode, and the AI verdict notice referenced a nonexistent CSS tone class**
  ([#703](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/703), [#704](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/704)).
- **The scenario panel's growth-rate default had no "not measured" caveat unlike its sibling inputs, and Benchmark group amounts on the "mix" basis were rounded independently and didn't sum to their own basis total**
  ([#754](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/754), [#755](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/755)).
- **Three sync-path performance fixes**: goal progress re-fetched full net-worth history per goal, `loadFacts` re-joined category names per month, and the AI proposal generator re-queried payee history per uncategorised transaction
  ([#711](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/711), [#712](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/712), [#713](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/713)); a transfer-crossing scan that ran three times per sync pass was also fixed ([#719](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/719)).
- **`PATCH /api/settings/integrations/ai` now merges submitted `modelPrices` onto the existing set instead of replacing it wholesale**
  ([#743](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/743)), so switching the fast/deep model no longer drops the price of a model that's no longer selected; `FreshnessBar`'s `jobs` prop is now typed against `Refreshable` so a typo in a job name fails `tsc` instead of a live refresh call ([#742](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/742)).
- **Assorted settings-panel bugs**: `clearApiKey`'s validation refine would have failed silently if ever wired to the UI ([#737](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/737)), `MembersPanel` kept shadowing `settings.invites` after creating an invite ([#738](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/738)), and several settings hint elements referenced CSS classes that didn't match their actual names, including a duplicate pair now consolidated ([#785](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/785), [#789](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/789)). Unused prompt-editor fields and an `/api/tags` series the frontend never reads were removed, along with their stale doc comments ([#740](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/740), [#741](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/741)).

## [2.5.1] — 2026-09-26

### Added

- **A property's rent, and a mortgage's monthly payment, can now be linked to an Actual Budget category**
  ([#643](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/643)). The link is validated for direction (rent must point at an income category, a payment at an expense one) and rejects a hidden category; once linked, a read-only line compares the stored figure against the category's actual spend/income for the latest synced month. Deliberately read-only for now — no reconciliation UX yet.

### Changed

- **Integrations settings splits into Actual Budget / Ghostfolio subtabs**, mirroring the earlier Net worth split
  ([#650](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/650)). Presentation only — the settings API is unchanged.
- **The Overview page's savings rate and savings goals now share one "Savings" card** instead of the rate sitting in the top metrics grid
  ([#652](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/652)).

### Fixed

- **The category-mapping table's COICOP division picker stayed enabled for income and hidden categories**, which the benchmark comparison already skips
  ([#651](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/651)). It's now disabled for both, matching the existing pattern on the shared/nature columns of the same row.
- **Saving a property with kind "owned" 400'd** — the `PATCH /api/settings/property` request schema hand-maintained a shorter kind list than the domain's own, even though the settings form already let a user pick it
  ([#658](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/658)).

## [2.5.0] — 2026-09-26

### Security

- **The egress guard's per-call host allowance was a process-global map, not actually scoped to the call that requested it**
  ([#548](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/548)). It now rides `AsyncLocalStorage`, so one tenant's in-flight request can no longer widen — even briefly — what a concurrent call from another tenant is allowed to reach.
- **A stored AI API key survived a changed custom OpenAI-compatible base URL, unlike the equivalent Actual/Ghostfolio secrets**
  ([#579](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/579)). Changing the base URL host now invalidates the stored key, matching the pattern already enforced for the other two integrations.
- **The local-auth failed-attempt counter and TOTP replay check were read-modify-write, not atomic**
  ([#550](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/550)), leaving a race that could let concurrent login attempts dodge a lockout or replay a TOTP code. Both are now atomic.
- **AES-256-GCM cipher/decipher calls didn't pin `authTagLength`**
  ([#616](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/616)), relying on Node's default instead of an explicit, defense-in-depth pin.
- **Digest email delivery allowed a silent cleartext fallback if the relay didn't offer STARTTLS**
  ([#580](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/580)). STARTTLS is now required by default.
- **Integration test-connection requests had no tenant-scoped rate cap**
  ([#588](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/588)), letting one tenant's test-connection traffic run unbounded.
- **`forgetProbe` deleted every tenant's probe row for a source, unscoped**
  ([#589](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/589)). It had no remaining callers, so it was removed rather than given a tenant-scoped path that would immediately go unused again.
- **Settings responses leaked another tenant's integration hostnames, sync id, model prices/budget, and pending invites to a viewer**
  ([#586](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/586)). All four are now masked from viewer-role responses.

### Added

- **Monthly digest as a downloadable PDF or an emailed one**
  ([#52](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/52)). The AI narrative can now be delivered as a rendered PDF or by email instead of only being viewed on the Insights page; digest mode, recipients, and stored PDFs are all tenant-scoped.
- **The audit trail is readable, not just written**
  ([#592](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/592)). An owner-only `GET /api/audit` route and a new "General > Audit trail" settings panel show an expandable before/after view; the tab is hidden entirely for viewers rather than shown and rejected.

### Changed

- **`SESSION_SECRET`, a required env var with no runtime consumer, has been removed**
  ([#552](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/552)). Existing deployments can drop it from `.env`; it was never read.

### Fixed

- **A generated migration's `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` was a no-op inside Drizzle's own transaction, so an upgrade could still cascade-delete child rows it meant to preserve**
  ([#577](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/577)).
- **An owner could permanently brick the settings screen by entering an unbounded `budgetEur` or AI model price, and overspend's own basis-point/cents fields had the same gap**
  ([#578](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/578), [#595](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/595)). Both are now bounded to what the app's own storage (`microEur`, cents) can represent.
- **A hung job could stall every tenant's queue — `buildDigestPdf` among them — with no timeout to break it**
  ([#583](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/583)). The job queue is now also scoped per tenant to match `jobsInFlight`'s own accounting ([#602](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/602)), and the sync job's compute-step writes ([#591](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/591)) and `saveMonthNote`'s read-modify-write ([#590](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/590)) now each run inside one transaction instead of several.
- **The month note was retained verbatim, forever, in `audit_log`, bypassing its own retention window**
  ([#581](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/581)). Household/digest change audit entries now record the shape of what changed rather than the values themselves ([#582](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/582)), and a failed apply-batch no longer echoes the raw exception message back to the caller ([#587](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/587)).
- **Digest recipients were exposed to each other and to a viewer instead of being bcc'd/masked**
  ([#572](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/572), [#573](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/573), [#584](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/584)). Recipients are now bcc'd on send and masked from viewer-role settings responses.
- **A stale digest PDF could survive a mode change or get served after switching away from PDF mode, and checking whether one existed loaded its full bytes into memory just to answer a boolean**
  ([#585](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/585), [#594](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/594)). The route now checks the current mode before serving a stored PDF (a migration also sweeps existing stranded rows), existence is a single-row check rather than a full blob load, and the embedded net worth chart is now capped at 180 points ([#609](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/609)).
- **Four whole-table reads did their sort/filter/limit in application code instead of SQL**
  ([#606](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/606)). `/api/insights`'s proposal target-name lookups are now batched instead of one-per-proposal ([#605](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/605)), and category mapping now has a targeted single-row lookup instead of scanning the whole table ([#607](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/607)).
- **The nightly `VACUUM INTO` ran on the main thread, blocking every other request for its duration**
  ([#608](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/608)). It now runs in a forked worker.
- **The migrations folder path used `URL.pathname` instead of `fileURLToPath`**
  ([#598](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/598)), which mishandles spaces and special characters in a filesystem path on some platforms.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-09-25

### Security

- **A "test connection" request could be tricked into sending a tenant's stored Actual/Ghostfolio secret to an attacker-controlled host**
  ([#534](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/534)). The stored-secret fallback (used when a test-connection request omits the password/token) is now gated on the candidate URL matching, scheme and host, the URL the secret was last verified against; a candidate URL embedding credentials (`user:pass@host`) is rejected outright.
- **A tenant's saved Actual/Ghostfolio URL widened the whole process's egress allowlist, not just that tenant's own traffic**
  ([#535](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/535)). `withScopedHost` (renamed from `withTestHost`) now grants a host for the duration of one call made on that tenant's behalf — Ghostfolio's real traffic included, not just its test-connection check — instead of adding it to a set every fetch in the process is checked against. A PATCH that changes a stored host now also invalidates the secret verified against the old one.
- **The Actual worker's real per-tenant traffic ran through a completely unguarded `fetch`, unlike its own test-connection check**
  ([#536](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/536)). Each tenant's long-lived worker process now installs the egress guard on open and scopes every later request to that tenant's own server URL, mirroring the pattern above already established for Ghostfolio.
- **AI retention nulled the old request/response text but left the full redacted payload readable indefinitely, including the one field sent unredacted (the month note)**
  ([#539](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/539)). Past `AI_RUNS_TEXT_RETENTION_DAYS`, `payload_json` is now cleared alongside it; the dedup hash is kept, since a hash can't be turned back into the payload it was computed from.
- **A remote Actual write could outlive a proposal that was rejected while the write was in flight, with nothing recording that it happened**
  ([#540](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/540)). That race is a known, accepted tradeoff — both remote handlers are idempotent, so recovery is a manual re-apply, not a double-apply — but it now logs a warning with the proposal's id, type, and target ref, so the re-apply has something to notice.
- **The README's privacy claims hadn't kept up with what the app actually does**
  ([#541](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/541), [#542](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/542)). It now discloses that the free-text month note is sent to the AI unredacted, by design, and that an approved proposal does write back to Actual — Ghostfolio remains unconditionally read-only.

### Added

- **Prompt versions can be given a short, household-chosen name**, distinct from the existing "why this version exists" note
  ([#530](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/530)).

### Changed

- **Settings shrinks from 13 top-level tabs to 7**
  ([#528](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/528)). AI provider config, Prompts, and the AI activity log move under one new AI section; Accounts, Property, Loans, Debts, and Goals move under a new Net worth section.

### Fixed

- **Checking one prompt version's safety verdict could flip a sibling version's badge back to "Not checked"**
  ([#529](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/529)). Each row's verdict is now tracked independently instead of sharing one last-checked slot.

## [2.3.9] — 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **A Dockerfile comment claimed every `FROM` was already a bare digest with
  no tag, contradicting the paragraph right after it explaining why the tag
  is kept**
  ([#526](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/526)). Reworded to
  describe what `pinDigests: false` actually governs — converting a floating
  tag to a digest, not refreshing an existing tag+digest pin. Comment-only,
  no build behavior changed.
- **A rate-limit test's cost and runtime depended on `RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_HOUR`,
  an ambient config value, rather than a value fixed by the test itself**
  ([#527](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/527)). The burst now
  loops against `AI_RATE_LIMIT.max`, the exact constant the route's limiter
  was actually built from, instead of independently re-reading config.

## [2.3.8] — 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Savings goals: category-linked goals, a required-monthly-savings figure,
  a pace status, and a done/archive lifecycle**
  ([#407](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/407),
  [#522](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/522),
  [#524](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/524)). Alongside the
  existing net-worth-kind goals (`liquid`/`invested`/`total`), a goal can now
  target a specific Actual Budget envelope's rolling balance, and several
  goals can share one envelope — the pool splits proportional to urgency
  (target amount over months remaining), not raw target size. Every goal
  with a target date gets a required-monthly-savings figure and a
  green/orange/red pace status against it. Marking a goal done archives it
  after a 7-day undo grace window rather than deleting it outright. Shown on
  Overview and as a per-category badge on the Budget page; category-linked
  goals route through the existing AI redaction so no raw category id or
  name reaches a narrative prompt.

## [2.3.7] — 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Settings → AI gained a log tab: every recorded call, with its exact raw
  request and response text**
  ([#497](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/497),
  [#501](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/501)). `ai_runs` now stores
  the exact system+instruction+data text prepared for the provider and the
  exact raw reply on every row, including `blocked`/`capped` calls (recorded
  as "prepared but never sent"); a `reused` row resolves its response from
  the run it points to rather than duplicating the text. The new tab lets a
  call be expanded to see both verbatim, the closest thing this app has to
  a debugger for what actually left the machine.

### Fixed

- **A rejudged past month's `net_worth_high` and `emergency_fund_short`
  signals, and the narrative bundle for a past month, no longer cite a net
  worth synced after that month closed**
  ([#498](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/498),
  [#504](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/504),
  [#505](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/505),
  [#508](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/508)). Both the narrative
  bundle and the nightly signals job read the tenant's *latest* net-worth
  snapshot regardless of which month was being analysed, so an earlier
  month's narrative or a rejudged past month could pick up a balance from
  well after that month ended — August's narrative citing September's net
  worth once September synced, or an emergency-fund signal for January
  judged against today's balance instead of January's own. Both now read
  the latest snapshot on or before the month's own end.
- **A stale Gemini prompt cache no longer fails every call until the
  process restarts**
  ([#499](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/499),
  [#506](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/506)). Google deletes a
  `caches.create()` resource server-side after its own TTL (one hour), but
  the held cache name was reused forever; a call made after the TTL sent a
  now-deleted name and failed outright with 403 `CachedContent not found`,
  with no retry or invalidation. A held cache is now treated as absent past
  its own TTL and recreated proactively, and — belt and suspenders — that
  specific 403 is caught once and retried with the instruction sent inline
  instead of failing the call.
- **Privacy mode now masks the figures in Findings, Pending and Ledger, the
  same as it already did for the Narrative**
  ([#489](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/489),
  [#507](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/507)). Narrative's own
  masking shipped in 2.3.4; these three render through
  normal React rather than raw markdown, so they reuse the existing
  `<Private>`/`data-private` mechanism instead of Narrative's `<amount>`
  tag — a sentence assembled from signals, a proposal's before/after
  fields and AI explanation, and the raw redacted request/response JSON
  are all wrapped now.
- **The AI log's run list can reach transcripts past the first 50**
  ([#502](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/502),
  [#509](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/509)). The log always
  asked for the newest 50 runs with no way to page past them, so once a
  tenant passed 50 recorded calls, everything older became permanently
  unreachable through the screen. A "Load older calls" button now pages
  backwards from a cursor.
- **`ai_runs`'s stored request/response text is now cleared after a
  retention window instead of growing forever**
  ([#503](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/503),
  [#511](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/511),
  [#512](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/512),
  [#515](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/515)). A new nightly job
  nulls the two text columns on rows older than
  `AI_RUNS_TEXT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90) — cost, tokens and status stay
  on the row forever, since the spend ledger and audit trail read those
  indefinitely. The nightly sweep now also remembers how far it swept last
  time, so it only rescans what's newly crossed the cutoff rather than
  the whole ledger every night.
- **A same-millisecond tie in the AI log no longer sorts in a coin-flipped
  order, and that ordering now survives any future migration that rebuilds
  the table**
  ([#510](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/510),
  [#513](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/513),
  [#514](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/514),
  [#519](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/519)). Two AI runs
  recorded in the same millisecond — routine in tests, possible for a fast
  nightly job — used to break their tie on a random UUID, an effective
  coin flip for "newest first." The tiebreak now uses a persisted `seq`
  column that reflects true insertion order and, unlike SQLite's implicit
  `rowid` it replaces, is carried through unchanged by any future
  migration that rebuilds the table.

### Changed

- Production image rebuilt against the current `cgr.dev/chainguard/node`
  base and Node 26.10.0, picking up upstream patches published since
  2.3.6.

## [2.3.6] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A negative expense-envelope figure in the AI narrative is now written as
  a positive amount, with the overspend carried in the wording instead of a
  bare minus sign**
  ([#494](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/494),
  [#496](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/496)). Rule 12 (#493)
  already told the model that a negative leftover figure on an expense
  envelope means an overspend, but said nothing about how to print the
  figure itself, so a sentence built around that explanation still ended
  in something like "leaving € -42,00" — the sign saying "negative" a
  second time, in punctuation, right next to prose already saying it in
  words. The rule now asks for the amount as a positive figure, with the
  shortfall carried entirely by the sentence around it.
- **The narrative card's byline, edited-prompt notice, stale banner and
  rewrite offer now sit below a rule and some spacing instead of running
  straight into the model's paragraph**
  ([#495](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/495),
  [#496](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/496)).

## [2.3.5] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **The AI narrative no longer leaks a raw internal field name into its
  prose, and now reads a category's negative leftover figure as an
  overspend instead of leaving it uninterpreted**
  ([#492](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/492),
  [#493](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/493)). The narrative
  prompt already told the model not to echo an internal field name
  verbatim, but that instruction lived only in the editable prompt body,
  with no backstop for an edit — or a stale, pre-existing install — that
  dropped it; the rule is now also restated in the code-owned guardrails
  appended to every call, so it can't be lost either way. Separately, a
  category's own leftover figure arrives signed, and nothing told the
  narrative pass what a negative one meant, so it read as an unexplained
  error rather than what it is: more was spent in that envelope than was
  set aside. The new rule is scoped to expense envelopes only — an income
  category's negative figure means a shortfall, not overspending, the same
  distinction the existing analysis findings already draw.

## [2.3.4] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **The AI narrative now masks the figures in its own prose under privacy
  mode, instead of leaving them fully readable**
  ([#489](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/489),
  [#490](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/490)). Privacy mode blurs a
  fixed set of elements by attribute, but `markdown.ts`'s whole safety
  argument rests on emitting no attribute at all, so a masked figure gets
  its own bare tag, `<amount>`, instead. Masking is deliberately
  over-inclusive — a year or a percentage gets blurred along with a euro
  amount, because a false negative here is a household's spending on
  someone's screen and a false positive is, at worst, a blurred date — and
  it also catches a figure the model chose to format as inline code, which
  would otherwise have been a way to switch masking off by accident. This
  covers the Narrative tab only; Findings, Pending and Ledger still show
  their figures unmasked and remain open under #489.
- **The Benchmark card's "Difference" column explains itself instead of
  reading as a third share figure**
  ([#401](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/401),
  [#491](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/491)). Difference isn't
  derived from the two share columns beside it — in a size-adjusted
  ("level") comparison it also carries any gap in the household's overall
  spending, not just how that spending splits between groups — so the
  column header now carries an info tooltip worded to match, branched on
  whether the comparison has a reference euro total on record at all.

## [2.3.3] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- **Category names can now be translated per locale, independent of whatever
  language the household typed them in on the Actual side**
  ([#479](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/479),
  [#487](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/487)). A new "category
  source language" setting on the Actual integration records the language
  the household actually authored its categories in; a per-locale
  translation table (owner-edited, empty by default — no machine
  translation) overrides the display name for any other supported locale
  everywhere a category name is rendered to a member, falling back to the
  source snapshot whenever no override exists. Changing the source locale
  now also clears out any translation rows already on file for the locale
  it's changing *to*, so a stale override can't silently keep outranking
  the fresh source snapshot forever; and a translation can no longer be
  written for a locale this deployment doesn't support in the first place.

### Fixed

- **The prompt editor no longer offers "make it active straight away" for a
  gated prompt key it can't actually activate immediately**
  ([#481](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/481),
  [#482](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/482)). The button rendered
  regardless of whether the key was gated behind the AI-judge safety check
  introduced in [#455](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/455),
  promising an activation that `resolvePrompt` would then refuse.
- **The AI narrative no longer relies on a prompt instruction to format
  cents and basis points for display — `redact()` does it directly**
  ([#476](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/476),
  [#477](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/477),
  [#478](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/478),
  [#480](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/480)). Asking the model to
  turn raw cents/bp figures into display strings itself was fragile — a
  rewritten narrative prompt and judge rubric narrowed how often it went
  wrong, but didn't remove the underlying risk of a model dropping the
  formatting instruction on some inputs. Formatting now happens inside
  `redact()` before the model ever sees the numbers, using the bundle's own
  `formatLocale`, closing the gap for good.

### Security

- **Fixed a path-traversal risk in how the Actual worker resolves its data
  directory** ([#483](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/483),
  flagged by Aikido as `Sast#728549212`). `getOrSpawnWorker` built a
  filesystem path from tenant-controlled input without constraining it to
  the intended data directory first.
- **Bumped `protobufjs` from `7.6.6` to `8.8.0`**
  ([#486](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/486)), fixing a
  denial-of-service advisory flagged by Aikido
  (`AIKIDO-2026-115254`).

## [2.3.2] — 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **The prompt editor can now delete a stored version, and "Check" always
  judges the text actually in the box**
  ([#475](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/475)). Every edit is a new
  row, but there was no way to remove one — only "Activate" (roll back)
  existed. Deleting is now allowed, including the active version:
  `resolvePrompt`'s built-in fallback already makes "no active row" a safe,
  visible state, so refusing would have just been a second guard on top of
  one that already works. Separately, the safety check used to target
  whichever stored row the box happened to resolve to rather than the box's
  own text, so an edit could silently return a stale cached verdict from an
  older version; the box now tracks the version it was last loaded from, and
  edited text is saved as a new version before it's checked. Copy no longer
  talks about "checking version 1" — the button just reads "Check" or "Save
  & check".

## [2.3.1] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- **`analysis.system` is now gated under `locked` too, and `PROMPT_EDITING`
  drops the now-redundant `analysis_only` mode**
  ([#468](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/468)). `PROMPT_EDITING`
  is `full` or `locked` — `locked` (the new default, previously `full`) puts
  both prompts behind the same AI-judge safety check `narrative.system` has
  had since [#452](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/452)–[#455](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/455);
  `full` leaves both fully editable, no gate. See Upgrading below for an
  installation with `analysis_only` set. Also adds a rule asking the
  analysis prompt to write clarification guesses in plain language, with no
  financial jargon.

### Changed

- **A `locked` customization is now layered as a short addition on
  Balancr's own base prompt, not a full replacement**
  ([#468](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/468)). Balancr's own
  instructions are always sent first, in full; a household's stored text
  follows as a lightweight addition that only has to avoid fighting the
  base rather than independently satisfy the whole rubric — which is what
  lets a short style note ("write in short sentences") pass instead of
  failing for not restating every rule. The prompt editor now shows
  Balancr's own base in a collapsed block under `locked` and relabels the
  textarea to "Additional instructions".
- **Dependency maintenance**: `@google/genai`, `jsdom`, the GitHub Actions
  runner image bumped to `ubuntu-26.04`, plus a lock-file maintenance pass —
  each verified by CI before merging, none behavior-visible.

### Upgrading

An installation with `PROMPT_EDITING=analysis_only` in `.env` will fail to
boot on this version. Switch it to `full` (no judge gate on either prompt)
or `locked` (the new default — both prompts stay editable, but a body must
pass a safety check before it can be activated).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- **A deployment-wide lock and safety gate for the editable narrative prompt**
  ([#452](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/452),
  [#453](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/453),
  [#454](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/454),
  [#455](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/455),
  [#459](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/459)). Edits to the one AI
  pass with no output-grounding are now bound in length, checked by a
  code-owned judge call before they can be activated, and enforced again at
  use time so a legacy row or direct edit can't bypass the check. A
  code-owned backstop clause is appended after the editable body so an
  edited prompt never gets the last word. `PROMPT_EDITING` (`full` /
  `analysis_only` / `locked`) lets an operator lock prompt edits deployment-wide;
  the prompt editor now shows what is actually stored under a lock instead of
  a substituted default.
- **Non-mortgage debt tracking: fixed-schedule loans and revolving
  credit-card debt** ([#441](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/441),
  [#442](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/442)), alongside the
  existing mortgage tracking.

### Changed

- **The frontend bundle now splits by route and loads ECharts on demand**
  ([#435](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/435)), cutting the
  initial page load's script size.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Provider-neutral AI configuration and execution**
  ([#406](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/406),
  [#422](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/422)-[#427](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/427)).
  Google Gemini remains available through AI Studio and Vertex AI; tenants can
  now also select official OpenAI and xAI/Grok presets, an operator-approved
  custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or native Anthropic Claude through the
  Messages API. Provider-specific authentication, structured-output handling,
  usage accounting and pricing now sit behind one shared boundary. Only Gemini
  through AI Studio has been tested end to end against a live provider; all
  other integrations are preview functionality covered by automated contract
  tests and should pass the settings panel's capability test before use.
- **Up to three mortgages per property**
  ([#393](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/393),
  [#402](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/402)), so a second mortgage,
  HELOC or renovation loan can sit alongside the primary loan. Existing stored
  properties migrate automatically, and portfolio balances and payments sum all
  attached loans.

### Changed

- **Overview now shows committed spending still to come as its own metric**
  ([#397](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/397),
  [#403](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/403)) instead of explaining
  the open month's savings-rate proration in prose.
- **Dead frontend code and implicit dependencies were removed**
  ([#404](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/404),
  [#405](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/405)); TypeScript now rejects
  unused locals and parameters in both server and web builds.

### Fixed

- **Benchmark category mappings are tenant-scoped on every read and write**
  ([#409](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/409),
  [#415](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/415)), closing a path that
  could disclose or modify another household's category settings.
- **AI prompts, spend totals and budget enforcement are tenant-scoped**
  ([#410](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/410),
  [#411](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/411),
  [#417](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/417),
  [#418](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/418)); one household can no
  longer change another's prompt or consume its allowance.
- **Every egress redirect is validated before it is followed**
  ([#412](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/412),
  [#419](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/419)), including connection
  tests that run in worker processes, so an approved URL cannot redirect a
  request to a disallowed destination.
- **Failed backup restores roll moved database files back into place**
  ([#413](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/413),
  [#420](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/420)); pre-restore names are
  collision-resistant and a failed install no longer leaves the live path absent.
- **Audit records retain and enforce their tenant metadata**
  ([#414](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/414),
  [#421](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/421)) instead of writing
  unscoped rows that could become a future isolation hazard.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09-18

### Added

- **A household now picks its own country** ([#244](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/244))
  in Settings → Household, and the benchmark comparison resolves its reference file
  from that country instead of always reading Belgium's. `BENCHMARK_PATH` (a single
  file) is now `BENCHMARK_DIR` (one file per country, `<dir>/<country>.yaml`); the
  shipped file moved from `config/statbel-benchmark.yaml` to
  `config/benchmark/be.yaml`. An existing deployment that set `BENCHMARK_PATH`
  needs to set `BENCHMARK_DIR` instead, pointing at the directory rather than the
  file. Six of the seven pickable countries (NL, DE, FR, ES, IT, US) have no file
  yet — the comparison card falls back to its existing "no comparison configured"
  empty state, the same one a missing or misconfigured file always produced. The
  budget card's wording is now demonym-driven off the loaded file's own
  jurisdiction rather than hardcoding "Belgian." Tax rules stay Belgium-only for
  now.

### Changed

- **The Belgian benchmark reference figure is inflation-adjusted to August 2026**
  ([#398](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/398)) instead of sitting at
  Statbel's 2024 survey price. It's scaled forward by chaining Eurostat's
  annual-average HICP for Belgium with Statbel's own national CPI (base
  2025=100), giving €3.952,95/month (395295 cents), up from €3.689,19. The
  figure's `status` moves from `confirmed` to `transcribed` since it's now a
  computed estimate rather than a value read straight off a Statbel table; the
  full derivation is documented in the file's own `notes` field.

## [2.0.5] — 2026-09-18

### Changed

- **The portfolio page's mortgage balance is now labelled as an estimate**
  ([#392](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/392)) — it was already a live
  amortization from the mortgage's anchor date rather than a fresh statement read,
  but nothing on screen said so. It now shows with a `≈` and an info tip naming the
  last-confirmed date, alongside a new "share of the original loan paid off" figure
  on both the settings page and the portfolio page.

## [2.0.4] — 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **Benchmark and Custody each drew their own Month/Year toggle for the comparison
  window**, styled with the same pill classes as the page's real calendar picker —
  two controls that read as one duplicated datepicker, and the smaller of the two
  clipped its own popover whenever a card's "no data" notice box was short. Both
  cards now just follow the page picker's own kind; there is exactly one date
  control on the page.

## [2.0.3] — 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **`2.0.2`'s production Docker build failed** before an image was ever published.
  `src/adapters/actual/api-source.ts` (added for #391's local-dev fake backend)
  statically imported a file under `scripts/`, which sits outside the production
  build's `src`-only `rootDir` — a difference `npm run typecheck` doesn't catch,
  since it type-checks against a more permissive config than the actual build does.
  The import is now built at runtime instead of written as a literal, so the
  build no longer resolves that file at all. `2.0.2` is superseded by this release;
  no image was ever pushed for it.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-09-18

### Added

- **A third property kind, `owned`** ([#390](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/390)),
  for a home the household owns outright but neither lives in nor rents out — bought
  outright, inherited, held for a family member. Sits alongside `primary`/`rental` in
  Settings → Property with no rent field and no cash-flow/yield reads, same as `primary`.
- **Local dev without a real Actual or Ghostfolio** ([#391](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/391)).
  `ACTUAL_FAKE_BACKEND=true` swaps in an in-memory fake Actual with a generated budget;
  `npm run fake:ghostfolio` stands up a fake Ghostfolio server; `npm run fake:seed` maps
  the fake categories to COICOP divisions and a custody split so Benchmark and Custody
  render real content too. See the README's "Local dev without real Actual/Ghostfolio".

### Fixed

- **Benchmark/Custody's own period toggle still looked like a second datepicker after
  2.0.1's fix** ([#389](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/389)). Moving the
  control into the card wasn't enough — it was still the same calendar-popover
  `PeriodPicker` the page's Month toolbar uses, with every date cell wired to a no-op
  unless the click happened to change Month/Year. It's now a plain two-state toggle with
  no popover pretending it can do more.
- **The mortgage rate showed only one decimal digit** — a rate typed to hundredths (e.g.
  4.41%) read back as 4.4%.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **Budget → Benchmark/Custody's own Period picker looked like a duplicate of
  the page's Month picker** ([#389](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/389)).
  Each card draws its own comparison-period picker above the page's separate
  Month toolbar with no card boundary between them, reading as the same
  control rendered twice. The picker now sits inside the card/notice box it
  belongs to instead of floating above it.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-09-18

Blessed by the person whose money it is. Every feature issue in the v2.0.0
Multi-tenant milestone is closed, and the two release candidates ran without
turning up anything beyond the three fixes already shipped in `rc.2`.

## [2.0.0-rc.2] — 2026-09-18

Three fixes found while shaking out rc.1.

### Fixed

- **Every Actual sync read crashed with "query.serialize is not a function"**
  ([#381](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/381)). `@actual-app/api`'s
  `aqlQuery` calls `query.serialize()` on its argument, but `queries.ts`
  already serializes the query before sending it over IPC to the worker fork
  — a live `Query`'s methods cannot survive structured cloning — so the
  worker called `aqlQuery` with an already-plain object that had no
  `.serialize()` of its own. The worker now re-wraps the plain state in an
  object whose `.serialize()` just returns it, satisfying the real package
  without changing how the IPC boundary serializes.
- **Settings' "Test connection" gave no feedback when clicked without
  retyping a stored secret**
  ([#382](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/382)). A secret field is
  always blank on load, so testing an already-configured Actual, Ghostfolio
  or Gemini connection without first retyping its password/token did
  nothing — the button was disabled with no explanation. The button is now
  enabled whenever a secret is available either typed or already stored,
  disabled with a visible inline hint otherwise, and a test against a
  blank secret field now falls back server-side to the tenant's own stored
  one rather than refusing — the stored secret is still never echoed back
  to the browser.
- **Sankey chart ("Where the money goes") node labels had no explicit
  colour** ([#383](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/383)). Every
  other chart element gets its colour from the shared ECharts theme, but a
  sankey series only inherits that global text colour when it sets no
  label config of its own — and this chart already sets `label.width`/
  `overflow` — so its labels fell through to ECharts' own undyed default
  instead.

## [2.0.0-rc.1] — 2026-09-18

Closes the v2.0.0 Multi-tenant milestone: every feature issue in it
([#367](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/367)-[#373](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/373),
[#376](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/376)-[#380](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/380))
is closed, so what remains before `2.0.0` is testing rather than building. A
single Balancr instance can now hold more than one household's data, each
isolated behind its own encrypted integration credentials, its own job
schedule and its own OIDC-issued tenant membership — while an existing
single-tenant deployment upgrades in place onto tenant 1 with no change to
what it shows.

### Added

- **Per-tenant data and integrations**
  ([#367](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/367),
  [#369](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/369)). Every table now
  carries a `tenant_id`; an in-place upgrade backfills one literal "Default"
  tenant onto all of it, so an existing deployment's data and behavior are
  unchanged. Actual and Ghostfolio credentials move from `.env` into the
  database, one row per tenant, imported once from `.env` on first boot after
  the upgrade and never read from there again.
- **Reversible field encryption for stored credentials**
  ([#368](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/368)). Integration
  credentials at rest are AES-256-GCM encrypted under a new required
  `CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. The app now refuses to boot without it — generate
  one with `openssl rand -base64 32` and add it to `.env` before upgrading.
- **Per-tenant integration clients and job scheduling**
  ([#371](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/371),
  [#372](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/372)). Actual, Ghostfolio
  and Gemini each get their own client instance per tenant, and the nightly
  jobs fan out over every tenant rather than assuming one.
- **`tenantId` threaded through the request, domain and job layers**
  ([#376](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/376)-[#380](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/380)).
  Every route and background job now carries a real tenant id instead of
  assuming the sole one; `/readyz` fans its checks out per tenant and reports
  the worst of each. Follow-up hardening closed the cross-tenant read paths
  this uncovered.
- **Self-service tenant onboarding**
  ([#373](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/373)), behind a new
  `MULTI_TENANT_ONBOARDING_ENABLED` flag that defaults to `false`. A new OIDC
  identity may only redeem an invite into an existing tenant until the flag is
  turned on; redeeming an invite is unaffected either way, since it never
  changes the tenant count.

### Upgrading from 1.x

Add `CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 raw bytes, base64-encoded — `openssl rand
-base64 32`) to `.env` before starting this version; without it the app will
not boot. No other action is required — migrations backfill the existing
data onto tenant 1 automatically, and `MULTI_TENANT_ONBOARDING_ENABLED`
stays off until it is explicitly turned on.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-09-16

Dependency, lockfile, and base-image maintenance — no user-facing behavior change.

### Fixed

- **Default `compose.yaml` image referenced the wrong Docker Hub namespace**, pointing at `nrosier/balancr` instead of the actual `niqck/balancr` published by CI.
- **Fastify updated to `^5.12.5`** (from `5.12.4`).

### Changed

- Dev dependencies and the npm lockfile refreshed to their current resolvable versions.
- Harbor replication and a vulnerability scan now trigger automatically after a release image is published.
- Production image rebuilt against the current `cgr.dev/chainguard/node` base, picking up upstream security patches published since 1.2.2.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-09-15

The production image moves from Alpine to Chainguard's Wolfi-based glibc image.

### Changed

- **Production Docker image is now Chainguard/Wolfi-based (glibc), not Alpine (musl)** ([#363](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/363)).
  Native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `argon2`) are built end to end on a glibc
  base, avoiding a musl/glibc mismatch. The container still runs as UID 1000
  rather than the base image's own nonroot default, so every existing
  self-hosted `/data` volume stays writable. The Alpine build is kept as
  `Dockerfile.alpine`, a reference/fallback no longer built by CI.

### Fixed

- **npm's `allowScripts` gate was silently blocking a nested `better-sqlite3` install script** vendored inside `@actual-app/api`/`@actual-app/core`, which ships no prebuilt binary and needs it to compile from source ([#363](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/363)).
  A sync job would fail with "Could not locate the bindings file" rather than
  loading the module. This affected the Alpine image too, not just Chainguard.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-09-15

The savings-rate card no longer reads better than an in-progress month will once
it closes.

### Fixed

- **Savings rate folds in this month's committed-but-unspent money** ([#361](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/361)).
  The rate for a still-open month only divided by spend that had already
  posted, so a schedule waiting to charge — rent, an insurance direct debit —
  was invisible to it until the money actually left the account. The rate's
  numerator now includes that committed spend, and the card names the amount
  with an "estimate" caveat when it applies; the separately-printed Spent
  figure keeps its existing posted-only meaning, which the Budget page's own
  Spent card and the digest both still rely on.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-14

The v1.1 polish batch is closed out, and net worth's Directly available figure
no longer conflates on-budget and off-budget liquid money.

### Changed

- **Directly available splits into On budget and Off budget** ([#359](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/359)).
  #353 named off-budget accounts and summed them into net worth's total, but
  Overview's Directly available row still mixed the two together — a reader
  had no way to tell how much of it sits outside the budget without opening
  Portfolio's off-budget list and subtracting by hand. The row now always
  shows both sub-figures when there is anything off-budget and liquid;
  Invested, Debt, Property value and Mortgage balance are unchanged.

## [1.1.6] — 2026-09-14

Findings gets the Month/Year period picker the other Insights tabs already had,
and net worth's total finally shows what its off-budget accounts are.

### Fixed

- **Insights → Findings gets the Month/Year period picker** ([#352](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/352)).
  Narrative and Ledger already picked up the month+year `PeriodPicker` in
  1.1.0; Findings kept the month-only picker because most of what it shows
  — over-assigned, burn-rate, baseline/irregular-expense, hygiene, drift —
  is irreducibly month-shaped. Year mode now shows each month's own
  findings, grouped by month, rather than inventing a year-shaped
  computation none of those signals have.
- **Off-budget Actual accounts are named, not just summed** ([#353](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/353)).
  Net worth's total has always included off-budget accounts (a mortgage, a
  house-value tracker) but never showed what they were. A new net-worth
  breakdown row and a Portfolio card now name them and their balance —
  deliberately independent of, and possibly overlapping, the existing
  Debt figure, since the two answer different questions.

## [1.1.5] — 2026-09-14

Fixes Budget → Overview's Spent and Income cards, which kept printing one
resolved month's figures even once the page's own picker was turned to Year.

### Fixed

- **Spent and Income sum the page's own year** ([#355](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/355)).
  Turning the picker to Year changed which month the server resolved
  `totals` for, but the Spent and Income cards kept the one resolved
  month's figures — unlike the savings-rate card beside them, already
  fixed in 1.1.4 to sum the same period. Both cards now reuse that same
  computation; assigned, available, left-to-assign and committed stay on
  the resolved month, since those are envelope states with no meaning
  summed over a year.

## [1.1.4] — 2026-09-14

Fixes Budget → Overview's savings-rate card, which was still choosable on its
own instead of following the page's own month/year picker.

### Fixed

- **Savings rate follows the Budget page's picker** ([#351](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/351)).
  #345's placement matrix called for one page-level picker driving every card
  on Budget's tabs, but the savings-rate card shipped with its own independent
  period control anyway. It now has no picker of its own there and simply
  reads whatever month or year the page's own picker is showing; the Overview
  page's copy, which has no other picker to follow, keeps its own.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-09-14

Rebuilds the Month/Year period picker and adds hoverable explanations to the
scenario simulator's and Settings → Thresholds' inputs.

### Added

- **Custom Month/Year period picker** ([#345](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/345)).
  Replaces `react-multi-date-picker` with a compact, self-built control — a
  sliding Month/Year pill toggle opening a popover with prev/next nav and a
  4×3 grid, styled entirely from `theme/tokens.css` with no calendar library.
  Months/years with no budget data are greyed out and unselectable; periods
  with incomplete data (the in-progress month, a year missing some months)
  stay selectable but their comparison figures — now including `SavingsRate`,
  not just Benchmark — are pro-rated. Placement is unified: one page-level
  picker drives all of Budget's tabs (Overview, Benchmark, Custody, Notes),
  Overview gets its own independent picker, Insights' Narrative/Ledger tabs
  gain a year alongside the existing month, and Portfolio's `?asOf=`
  filtering is reverted in favor of always showing the latest snapshot.
- **Hoverable field explanations** ([#346](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/346)).
  A new `InfoTip` control — the app's first hover/click-reveal tooltip
  primitive — sits next to each input's label on the scenario simulator and
  every one of Settings → Thresholds' ~22 tuning parameters, opening on
  hover, focus or click and dismissing on blur, outside click or Escape.
  Copy-only: no value, default, or validation behavior changes.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-09-14

Restyles `SectionNav`'s tab strip ([#349](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/349)).

### Changed

- **Shelf-style tab bar.** Both tab tiers move from underline tabs to a
  rounded, bordered "shelf": the active tab's background matches the
  content panel below it, so it fuses into the panel rather than floating
  above it, on Budget, Insights, Portfolio and Settings (primary and
  `sub` tiers alike). Fixes a bug where a nested settings URL didn't
  highlight its owning top-level tab. Benchmark's two-tier
  household/comparison nesting is flattened into one flat row of three
  siblings — Household, Categories, Comparison.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-09-13

Promotes `1.1.1-rc.1`'s period picker out of pre-release, plus routine
dependency maintenance picked up while it was being tested.

### Changed

- **Dependency maintenance**: Fastify, `zod`, `@google/genai`, `yaml`, and a
  Node.js engine/toolchain bump (`.nvmrc`, `Dockerfile`), plus a lock-file
  maintenance pass — each verified by CI before merging, none behavior-visible.

## [1.1.1-rc.1] — 2026-09-13

Real-world testing of one slice of `1.1.1`, ahead of the patch itself.

### Added

- **Calendar-backed Month/Year period picker, shared by Benchmark and
  Portfolio.** Benchmark's plain Month/Year `<select>` becomes an actual
  calendar control (`react-multi-date-picker`) rather than two radio options
  wearing a dropdown. The same picker now sits on Portfolio too, where it's
  new functionality rather than a restyle: Portfolio never had a period
  selector at all, so picking a past month or year now sends a real
  `?asOf=` request and shows that period's own snapshot instead of always
  the latest one. A period with nothing at or before it reads as the same
  empty state a never-synced portfolio already shows; the value chart,
  property card, and advice stay unfiltered by a historical `asOf`, on
  purpose.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-12

Closes the v1.1 milestone: small fixes and polish shipped after v1.0.0. Everything
in this milestone besides the two features below already shipped as `1.0.1`,
`1.0.2` and `1.0.3`.

### Added

- **Scenario simulator** ([#51](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/51)). A
  what-if calculator, seeded with the household's own numbers rather than an
  arbitrary round figure: its current monthly investment contribution and its
  current invested net worth. Editing the amount, growth rate, horizon, or the
  recurring/one-time toggle recomputes the projection instantly in the browser,
  with no additional request. A one-time lump sum is the same compounding math as
  a recurring change, applied only in month one; loan/bond scenarios are left for
  a later issue.
- **Benchmark card period picker: Month / Year, pro-rated**
  ([#323](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/323)). The Statbel benchmark
  card can now compare against a full year to date instead of only the latest
  month, pro-rating the reference side for any period that isn't a finished whole
  month. The nightly `above_benchmark` signal is pro-rated the same way, so the
  API and the nightly job can't disagree about what the comparison says.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Off-budget transfers no longer break data-quality reconciliation**
  ([#333](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/333)). A transfer that
  crosses the on-budget/off-budget boundary keeps a real category on its
  on-budget leg in Actual, but Balancr's own recomputed spend was
  unconditionally excluding every transfer as a same-side wash — so a
  transfer between an on-budget and an off-budget account made that
  category's own sum disagree with Actual's by exactly the transferred
  amount, surfacing as a false "does not reconcile" data-quality finding.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Data Quality card explains what's costing points**
  ([#329](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/329)). Each deduction
  row on the Overview page's Data Quality card is now a disclosure button
  when there are matching findings behind it — clicking it renders the
  specific finding sentences via the same catalogue the Insights and
  Budget pages already use, instead of leaving someone to guess which
  transaction or account a deduction is even about. A deduction with no
  matching findings still renders as plain text, no button.
- **Ghostfolio's endpoint checks moved onto its own Services card**
  ([#331](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/331)). The per-path
  probe detail used to live only under the Queue tab, separate from the
  Ghostfolio card's own at-a-glance verdict on Services. It now sits
  behind a disclosure button on the card itself — the same click-to-expand
  pattern as the Data Quality card above — so seeing *why* Ghostfolio is
  degraded no longer means switching tabs.
- **Queue tab's job and probe lists now render as cards**
  ([#325](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/325)), matching the
  Services tab's own grid instead of the bordered list rows left over from
  before that split.
- **AI usage monitoring moved from its own Settings tab into Status**
  ([#325](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/325)). Nothing on the
  old Spend tab was actually a setting — it was read-only cost/usage
  monitoring plus a single "run an analysis now" control — so it now lives
  behind the AI service card, the same way Services already answers "is my
  stuff working" for Actual and Ghostfolio. Settings loses its standalone
  Spend nav entry.
- **Household split into Household/Comparison sub-tabs**
  ([#327](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/327)). Settings →
  Benchmark → Household used to mix "who lives here" (roster and
  shared-cost editing) with "what we compare against" (the Statbel
  average-household correction) in one form; they're now separate
  sub-tabs, both kept mounted so switching between them never discards an
  in-progress edit.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-09-11

The status page answers "is my stuff working" at a glance instead of a
four-row checklist.

### Added

- **Status panel: three at-a-glance service cards replace the flat check
  list** ([#325](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/325)). Actual
  Budget, Ghostfolio and AI — the three things someone actually wants to
  check — now render as their own cards on a new Services tab, each with a
  badge and a last-synced time instead of being buried inside a list of
  eight jobs and four raw health checks. Everything that used to be on the
  page — the full job list, per-path Ghostfolio probe detail, and the
  danger-zone reset control — moved to a second Queue tab rather than being
  dropped.
- **Sync's named steps and `buildJobHistory` are now tested against a real
  run** ([#326](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/326)). The
  per-job history the Queue tab's "Show history" toggle reads had shipped
  with no test coverage of its own; it now has both, plus a
  `JOB_HISTORY_KEEP`-bounded history table and `/api/status/history`
  endpoint backing it.

### Fixed

- **The Queue tab redirected straight back to Services on click.** Settings'
  own General/Status tab strip and the Services/Queue tab strip nested
  inside it both use the same "replace an incomplete path with its tab's
  canonical one" mechanism, and the outer one didn't know `/settings/status/queue`
  was a path the inner one already owned — every attempt to open the Queue
  tab landed back where it started within one render. Only showed up under
  a real browser session, not the unit tests, which render `StatusPanel` on
  its own.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-09

Blessed by the person whose money it is. Every feature milestone is closed, the
release-candidate series ran without turning up a regression that survived to ship,
and the three items below are shipped as documented, accepted limitations rather
than treated as blockers — the choice `rc.1`'s own checklist left open.

### Added

- **Uitgavetempo also reads the buffer, not just the budget**
  ([#324](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/324)). The burn-rate projection
  flagged a category the same way whether or not there was anything left to absorb
  it: someone who overbudgets on purpose some months, to build a cushion for the
  months they don't, saw every drawdown month read as a plain overspend warning,
  indistinguishable from one with no cushion at all. The signal now also projects
  the envelope's own available balance — carry-in included — forward by the same
  amount the projection adds beyond what has already been spent, and escalates from
  `warn` to `alert` only when that balance would end the month past
  `overspend.availableFloorCents` in the red — the same line `over_available`
  already draws on the balance itself.

### Known, shipped as documented limitations

- **The break-glass local login is unreachable in the shipped topology**
  ([#297](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/297)). Because the container
  publishes no host port, the peer address is always the reverse proxy — so the
  credential documented as existing "for when nobody can sign in" can be enrolled
  and never used. Fail-safe in the security direction, and a recovery path that does
  not work; this ships as a documented gap rather than a blocker.
- **Two verification boxes stay unwalked**
  ([#47](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/47)): the cost cap's degrade path
  against a real key, and the rate limits under a deliberate burst. Both need a
  decision on somebody's own deployment rather than on code, and neither blocks
  this release.

## [1.0.0-rc.8] — 2026-09-09

The committed-spend check finally covers every day of the month, not just today.

### Fixed

- **A schedule paid a day or two off its computed date was still counted as
  still to come** ([#321](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/321)).
  `rc.6`/`rc.7` fixed this only for a transaction dated exactly `today`; an
  approximate schedule — Actual's own "around a date" option — routinely
  posts a transaction a day or two early or late, which that exact check
  never recognised. The bill's amount then landed in both real spend and the
  "still to come" total, overstating the burn-rate projection by exactly
  that amount. The check now counts a linked transaction anywhere in the
  month, the same tolerance Actual's own "Paid" status already gives it.
- **Chart tooltips showed the literal text `<span data-private>€ 123</span>`
  instead of a blurred figure** ([#319](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/319)).
  The budget-vs-assigned bullet chart, category trend sparkline and
  net-worth line chart built their tooltip through ECharts' `valueFormatter`,
  which escapes its return value as plain text rather than inserting it as
  HTML — so the `<span>` meant to become a blurrable DOM node showed up as
  literal tag text instead. All three now build the tooltip through a full
  `tooltip.formatter`, the same mechanism the two charts that never had this
  problem already used.

## [1.0.0-rc.7] — 2026-09-09

rc.6's fix didn't fix anything. This one does.

### Fixed

- **`next_date` is not Actual's "already posted" signal, so rc.6's fix for
  [#315](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/315) never fired**
  ([#317](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/317)). Actual's own
  background schedule-advancer declines to move `next_date` past today's
  occurrence on the exact day it falls due, even once a transaction has
  posted against it — so a same-day bill already paid was still double-
  counted, exactly as before rc.6. The committed-spend figure now checks for
  a transaction linked to the schedule instead, the same signal Actual's own
  UI reads to show "Paid" rather than "Due".

## [1.0.0-rc.6] — 2026-09-09

Another one found by using it, in the figure the rc.5 control exists to fix in bulk.

### Fixed

- **A same-day schedule occurrence already posted was still counted as still
  to come** ([#315](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/315)). The
  committed-spend figure that feeds the burn-rate projection compared an
  occurrence's date against today only, so a bill due today that had already
  posted — and was marked paid — landed in both the month's real spend and
  the "still to come" total, overstating the projected month-end figure by
  that bill. Actual's own `next_date` advances past an occurrence once it
  posts; a `next_date` after today is now read as that signal, and the
  occurrence moves to "already fell this month" instead.

## [1.0.0-rc.5] — 2026-09-08

The general-purpose version of the fix `rc.4` needed by hand.

### Added

- **An owner-only Settings control that force-resets every table Balancr
  computes** ([#313](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/313)). Wipes
  budget facts, signals, net worth and portfolio snapshots — the nine tables
  `src/db/schema.ts` marks as rebuilt idempotently — and starts the same jobs
  a nightly run would, recomputing everything from Actual, Ghostfolio and
  current settings. Source data, account and category configuration, and the
  AI ledger are all left alone; the ledger deliberately so, since deleting it
  would make the monthly spend guard think less had been spent than actually
  had. Two presses, the same weight every other destructive-ish control in
  Settings already gets: an armed state, then confirm or cancel.

## [1.0.0-rc.4] — 2026-09-08

Another fix from using it: the same projection `rc.3` touched, still wrong for a
different shape of category.

### Fixed

- **The spending-pace projection now reads a category's own day-of-month shape,
  not just a flat rate** ([#311](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/311)).
  Even with `rc.3`'s two-transaction floor, a linear extrapolation still misjudges
  two common shapes: a bill that reliably lands in a narrow window (a utility bill
  always posting days 8–13) reads as overspending until that window arrives, and a
  category with a stable total but scattered timing can read as "ahead of pace"
  simply because its spending happened to land early this month. The projection now
  builds a historical day-of-month curve per category and uses it once — and only
  once — that history is consistent enough to trust; a category whose timing is too
  scattered to project from falls back to the existing flat-rate formula unchanged,
  so a false gate never produces a worse answer than before.

## [1.0.0-rc.3] — 2026-09-08

One fix, found the same way `rc.2`'s were: using it.

### Fixed

- **The spending-pace projection stopped treating one transaction as a rate**
  ([#309](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/309)). A category with a
  monthly lump sum and no Actual schedule behind it — a hand-entered utility
  bill, a haircut — read as "all spent on day 3" and got extrapolated over the
  rest of the month as if that were a trickle, projecting several times the
  budget from a single data point. The variable half of the burn-rate
  projection (#159's already-committed half is unaffected) now stays at zero
  until a category has a second transaction this month; already-spent and
  already-committed figures still count in full, so a category genuinely over
  budget on one transaction alone still warns.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] — 2026-09-07

Six fixes from walking `rc.1` against a real deployment, and one new setting. Four
are places the app knew something and did not say it; one is a button that did
nothing; the setting is a question the AI boundary could not previously answer.

### Added

- **A third answer per envelope: keep it out of the payload entirely**
  ([#278](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/278)). An envelope could be
  ordinary or flagged sensitive, where sensitive still sent the figures under an
  opaque label — on the argument that a number with no name attached is not private.
  That argument is sound and it is not the whole of what somebody means when they ask
  for a category to be left out of the AI. Settings → Benchmark → Categories now has
  a "Sent to the AI" column with three choices, and the third excludes the envelope
  from the request altogether: no name, no class, no amounts of its own, and no
  finding, narrative sentence or budget suggestion about it. The month's totals are
  *not* recomputed to hide it — a month whose figures do not add up is worse than a
  labelled envelope — so what crosses instead is a count and one combined figure
  saying how much was withheld, and both prompts are told the gap is a deliberate
  choice rather than a data error, so no pass tries to work back to it. The cost is
  stated rather than buried: an excluded envelope gets no advice of any kind.

### Fixed

- **The month in words reads the month's note**
  ([#298](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/298)). The note was collected,
  stored, and read by the budget nudge, and never put in front of the narrative — so a
  movement the household had already explained in writing came back described as
  unexplained drift. The note now crosses on the narrative call and on no other: one
  redaction produces two payloads differing in exactly that field, and the findings
  pass is sent none of it, because the question of whether *it* should read a note is
  one this issue deliberately left open and answering it silently would be worse than
  leaving it open. A new prompt rule is the mirror of the one above it — the note
  licenses an explanation and is never a source of figures — so a note saying "about
  €400" cannot put €400 in a paragraph no computation produced, and a broken
  dishwasher explains one month rather than starting a trend. Because a narrative is
  cached per month, a reader who wrote the note *after* reading the review would have
  got the same paragraph back; the page now compares the note a review was written
  from with the note there is, and offers a rewrite the way it does for a moved fact. A
  deleted note counts as changed, which matters more than an added one. And the one
  field where what reaches Google is the owner's decision rather than the redactor's is
  now said as much, in the panel hint and in the README.
- **The stale-review rewrite handed back the paragraph it was replacing**
  ([#306](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/306)). The banner saying the facts
  have moved since a review was written offered to re-run it, and posted without the
  flag that replaces a cached row — so the button returned the very paragraph the
  banner was complaining about, with no error and no clue that nothing had happened.
  One prop was choosing both what the request sends and how the button reads.
- **The custody tab says why there is no split**
  ([#280](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/280)). Two of the reasons a split
  is unavailable drew an empty pane, which reads as a bug rather than as an answer.
  That was defensible while the figures shared a page with an empty-month notice, and
  stopped being so when the comparison moved behind a tab of its own. Each reason now
  says its own thing, because two of them are somebody's own arrangement rather than a
  fault and they do not deserve the same sentence.
- **The Benchmark tab says why there is no comparison, for all four reasons**
  ([#300](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/300)). The same gap in the same
  kind of pane one tab over, found by going looking for the first one's siblings.
- **Overview's savings rate can be read over a period**
  ([#296](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/296)). The Budget page's card got
  a period chooser in `0.11.6` and Overview's did not, because the server was not
  sending the flows it needed. One calendar month is the reading most distorted by when
  a salary or a large bill happened to land, so two cards disagreeing about the same
  household was the confusing half of shipping it in one place first.

### Known before 1.0.0

Unchanged from `rc.1`, and both waiting on a decision rather than on code:

- **The break-glass local login is unreachable in the shipped topology**
  ([#297](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/297)). Because the container
  publishes no host port, the peer address is always the reverse proxy — so the
  credential documented as existing "for when nobody can sign in" can be enrolled and
  never used. Fail-safe in the security direction, and a recovery path that does not
  work.
- **Two verification boxes are unwalked**
  ([#47](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/47)): the cost cap's degrade path
  against a real key, and the rate limits under a deliberate burst.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] — 2026-09-07

The first release candidate. **No functional change from `0.11.6`** — nothing to
hunt for in the diff but the version. What makes it a candidate is that every
feature issue in the milestone list is closed, so what remains before `1.0.0` is
testing rather than building.

### Verified

- **No header authenticates.** Nothing in the codebase reads
  `X-authentik-username`; the name appears only in comments explaining why it is not
  read. Sign-in is a real OIDC code flow with PKCE, so the reverse proxy's
  configuration is not the security boundary and there is a server-side session to
  revoke. Confirmed live: the forged header is refused alone, with companions, and
  with a loopback `X-Forwarded-For` beside it, on more than one authenticated route.
- **The local login cannot be reached from outside.** Refused through the public
  tunnel and refused from the local network, unmoved by `X-Forwarded-For` (loopback,
  an in-range private address, a two-hop chain), `X-Real-IP`, or a different private
  block. The gate reads the TCP peer address and never a header, which is the only
  reason it is worth anything.
- **The AI boundary is structural.** Every outbound payload interface is written by
  hand, so there is no payee, memo or transaction-id *field* for a filter to miss —
  only opaque labels cross, with the mapping kept server-side, asserted by a test
  that greps the serialised payload for the words themselves.

### Known before 1.0.0

- **The break-glass login is unreachable in the shipped topology**
  ([#297](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/297)). Because the container
  publishes no host port, the peer address is always the reverse proxy — so the
  credential documented as existing "for when nobody can sign in" can be enrolled
  and never used. Fail-safe in the security direction, and a recovery path that does
  not work.
- **Two verification boxes are unwalked**
  ([#47](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/47)): the cost cap's degrade path
  against a real key, and the rate limits under a deliberate burst. Both need a
  decision on somebody's own deployment rather than code.

## [0.11.6] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **The savings rate reads over a period, not one calendar month**
  ([#288](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/288)). One month is the reading
  most distorted by when a salary or a large bill happened to land: a quarterly
  insurance premium can turn a perfectly ordinary month into a rate somebody worries
  about. The Budget page's savings card now carries a chooser — this month, the
  previous month, since January, or the trailing twelve — and opens on twelve, the
  reading least sensitive to a calendar boundary. It sums before it divides: a
  period rate is total income minus total spending over total income, never the
  average of the monthly rates, because that average carries every boundary
  distortion into itself and on a month that earned nothing is arbitrarily wrong. A
  negative rate is not clamped and a window with no income says "not known yet"
  rather than 0%, since both are facts worth printing as themselves. The card also
  names the span it used, so a period reaching further back than the data does not
  quietly read as twelve months of figures. No extra request: `/api/budget` already
  ships two years of monthly flows, so switching periods is arithmetic on what the
  page is holding. The Overview page's own savings card still shows one month —
  giving it a period needs the server to send flows it does not send yet
  ([#296](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/296)).

### Changed

- **`npm run probe` is now the reconciliation acceptance test**
  ([#46](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/46)). It reconciled one month —
  and on a real budget file that was `months.at(-1)`, a month the calendar has not
  reached, so it reconciled zero against zero and proved nothing. It now takes the
  last three months that have *started*, because the failures worth catching only
  show over a span: a month containing a transfer, a carryover that drifts as it
  rolls forward, a category renamed mid-quarter. A category total that disagrees
  with Actual's own now fails the probe rather than printing beside it. The
  Ghostfolio side was shape-level only, so the number a household would actually
  check was the one number nothing checked; it now compares the portfolio figures
  Balancr would store against Ghostfolio's own, through the same functions the
  nightly job uses, split into total, invested and cash at the broker — because a
  cash position counted as an investment leaves the total right and every allocation
  share wrong, and a single comparison would pass. Net worth against the portfolio
  page warns rather than fails: only somebody looking at both can say whether the
  difference is cash the two views count differently. The tolerance is derived from
  how many times the cent conversion rounds, not chosen.

### Fixed

- **The probe stopped warning that an envelope budget is not an envelope budget**
  ([#293](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/293)). It tested for the budget
  type Actual stopped calling `rollover`, so a healthy envelope budget was reported
  as suspect while `tracking` — the one budget type whose carryover figures really
  are not what the budget means — passed in silence. It now asks the same shared
  vocabulary the server side already used. Found by the new acceptance test against
  a live Actual 26.9.0.

- **`currentValueInBaseCurrency` is documented as the trap it is.** It reads like
  the Ghostfolio portfolio total and holds the *invested* half, so anything
  comparing a total against it reports every instance holding cash as broken by
  precisely the amount of cash. The two fields the dashboard actually prints are now
  declared rather than merely surviving a loose schema, and `cash` — which came back
  negative on the reporting instance while the real broker cash was positive — is
  documented as not being the cash. Pinned by tests on an invented fixture,
  including the equation of the trap itself, so CI catches the class of bug without
  a real Ghostfolio.

## [0.11.5] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **A shared cost says which side of it lands in Actual**
  ([#289](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/289)). A €600 line flagged as
  shared with a co-parent is either a whole invoice you bear 60% of, or your 60%
  of a €1.000 cost — and nothing in the data distinguishes them. Balancr assumed
  the first, which on the other arrangement applies the share twice: €700 paid at
  a stated 70% was reported as €490 borne with €210 owed to you, when the truth is
  €1.000 in total, €700 yours, and nothing owed by anybody. Settings → Benchmark →
  Household now has a picker for it, with a note quoting your share back in
  whichever reading is selected, and the budget card's lede, caption, column
  heading and stated assumption all change with it. A gross-up is a weaker claim
  than a discount — one divides a figure Actual holds, the other infers one it has
  never held — so the card says so outright. Actual's own figure is untouched in
  both directions, and "shared costs are N% of what you spent" stays measured
  against what the account actually holds, or a grossed-up total would push it
  past 100%. Every roster already saved reads exactly as it did.

- **The average Belgian household ships filled in, and can be corrected**
  ([#290](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/290)). The euro comparison was
  built and switched off: `reference_household` shipped commented out, so a
  configured roster changed the numbers on screen not at all, because in the
  fallback mix basis a household's size cancels out algebraically. It now carries
  the 2024 Household Budget Survey's figures — spending per household over twelve
  months, and a size of 1,5066 equivalent adults derived as spending per household
  ÷ spending per consumption unit, which is the ratio that matches the modified
  OECD scale the file already uses rather than the mean size in people the scale
  exists to avoid. Confirming it meant opening the spreadsheet on the ten group
  shares too: every line moved by at most 3 basis points, so the budget card's
  "not yet confirmed at the source" caveat is gone. Balancr cannot fetch any of
  this itself — no API, a download URL with a publication date in it, sheet labels
  that move between editions — so Settings can correct it: both numbers or
  neither, with a citation you type, never marked confirmed however carefully it
  was read, stamped server-side, and reset clears the row rather than storing a
  copy of the shipped file.

### Fixed

- **The narrative stopped costing two model calls per run**
  ([#282](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/282)). Every narrative logged
  `hit MAX_TOKENS; retrying once at a higher ceiling`, so every narrative was two
  calls: one that produced nothing usable and was billed in full, and one at the
  retry ceiling that produced the answer. The ceiling was sized for the prose the
  reader gets, but the deep model thinks first and its thoughts are billed as
  output — so a ceiling sized for prose alone is one the model can exhaust without
  answering. Cost goes down, not up: roughly 7.800 billed output tokens across two
  calls becomes at most 8.000 across one, and the pre-flight estimate stops
  understating a run.

- **The household form says which box is wrong, which is empty, and why Save is
  greyed out** ([#283](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/283),
  [#287](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/287)). Add someone gave a row
  with no year of birth, so the row was invalid, so the panel's only Save was
  disabled — and nothing on screen said either of those things. The row printed a
  number-format rule, which reads as a complaint about text nobody had typed, and
  the disabled Save gave no reason at all. Each box now gets its own sentence
  naming the box and the mistake it is most likely to be, a wrong box carries
  `aria-invalid` and a red border tied to that sentence, and the reason Save is
  disabled sits beside Save. An empty box is deliberately left unmarked: a row
  from Add someone would otherwise announce itself as an error before you had
  touched it.

- **The Notes tab no longer shows a month picker that does nothing**
  ([#281](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/281)). It showed two month
  selectors and only one of them worked — the toolbar picker refetched a payload
  that tab renders nothing from, while the note kept the month it mounted with. An
  inert control and a wasted request per click. Hidden on that tab rather than
  removed, because Overview, Benchmark and Custody are all views of one month and
  it is the only control they have; picking March on Overview and opening Notes
  still opens March's note.

## [0.11.4] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Every proposal card says why it proposes that number**
  ([#273](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/273)). A budget-amount
  proposal used to show a before → after diff, an editable amount, and nothing
  about where the figure came from — while the reasoning existed at every stage
  and was discarded at every stage. A card now carries one line: which envelope
  signal fired and how many months the trailing average used, that there was too
  little history to average, that the budget nudge moved it after reading the
  month's note, or that you set the amount yourself. Stored as a code and its
  numbers rather than a sentence, so a proposal explained in Dutch today reads
  correctly in English tomorrow; the nudge's own reason is the one that cannot be
  a code, so the model writes it, bounded and grounded, with a mechanical
  sentence taking over whenever what it wrote is unusable. A bad sentence never
  costs a good amount its proposal.

### Fixed

- **The month note has its own Budget tab instead of appearing above every one**
  ([#272](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/pull/272)). The per-month note
  [#270](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/270) introduced was rendered
  above the tab strip, so it followed you onto Envelopes, Trend and every other
  subsection whether or not you were thinking about it. It is now a tab of its
  own.

### Documentation

- **What leaves the machine, and how to copy the database**
  ([#48](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/48)). Two questions the source
  answers only if you are willing to read `redact.ts` and `jobs/ai.ts` first, which
  is not a fair thing to ask of someone deciding whether to point this at their own
  money. The README now states which four hosts are ever contacted and that only
  one of them is a third party, which Google endpoint and why a free-tier key is
  the configuration to avoid, that the nightly pass is the only unattended spend
  and a page load never calls a model, and where in the app to read back the exact
  payload of every call ever made. It also says plainly what marking a category
  sensitive does *not* withhold — the amounts and the classification stay, so a
  broad category is still inferable — because a privacy claim with an unstated
  exception is worse than no claim
  ([#278](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/278) tracks a real
  per-envelope exclusion). And, for the reader who legitimately runs without
  `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` because a host snapshot covers the volume: which two files
  that snapshot has to catch, and why the app should be stopped first.

### Changed

- **Renovate's weekly lockfile refresh merges itself on green**
  ([#275](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/275)). A
  `lockFileMaintenance` pull request has nothing reviewable in it: `package.json`
  does not change, so only transitive versions move, and only inside the ranges
  their parents already allow. CI passing is the whole review. GitHub's own
  auto-merge stays off, because it waits for *required* status checks and this
  repository has no branch protection to require any — Renovate polls the checks
  itself instead.

## [0.11.3] — 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **The budget note moved from Settings to Budget, and from one note to one
  per month** ([#270](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/270)). The
  free-text note ([#217](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/217)) used
  to live on Settings' "AI usage" tab as a single running string framed as
  "what's coming up." It is now a card above the tab strip on the Budget
  page, keyed by month: mostly context for the current month's own spending
  ("replaced the dishwasher this month, that's why household appliances is
  higher than expected") rather than a forward-only heads-up, though writing
  ahead for a known future one-off still works the same way. The budget
  nudge on the Insights page now reads the note for the month it is actually
  nudging, instead of one note shared across every month. The month stepper
  on the new card is disabled while an edit is unsaved, the same guard
  [#268](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/268) added for
  Benchmark's household draft.

## [0.11.2] — 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Thresholds, Benchmark and General split into subsection tabs**
  ([#262](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/262)), the same tab-strip
  component (#200) already used one level up, reused a level deeper.
  Thresholds gets one subsection per threshold group, still derived from the
  payload's own schema rather than a hand-written list, so a group added to
  the aggregation engine still shows up with no edit here. Benchmark splits
  into the household roster and the category mapping table; General keeps
  the language control and build info together and moves the status panel,
  which polls its own endpoint on its own cadence, to its own tab.

### Fixed

- **The narrative default named a specific household**
  ([#261](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/261)). The built-in
  narrative system prompt's opening sentence described this app's own real
  deployment instead of a household in the generic terms every other prompt
  in the file uses — real, identifying detail hardcoded into shipped source
  and, now that the repo is public, visible to anyone who clones it. The
  shared-custody-cost behavior it was gesturing at is already handled
  generically by its own rule elsewhere in the same prompt, so the sentence
  is dropped rather than rewritten. Existing installations upgrade to the
  new default on their next boot, the same mechanism the #183 drift-rule
  upgrade used.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- **The 12-month forecast projecting a one-off as if it recurred, and ignoring
  untagged spend entirely** ([#49](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/49),
  reported directly against the just-shipped forecast as "too optimistic"). An
  `irregular`-cadence income or fixed category was being repeated forward every
  twelve months by mistakenly borrowing `baseline.ts`'s smoothing-window map as a
  repeat interval — a single bonus or gift read as an annual one. It's now
  excluded from repetition entirely. Separately, spend in categories nobody has
  tagged `fixed`/`income` contributed nothing to the forecast's cost side; the
  household's own already-computed average total spend is now added as a flat
  monthly floor on top of any tagged categories and detected bills.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added

- **A 12-month cashflow forecast** ([#49](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/49)).
  A new `/forecast` page projects the checking balance forward a year from
  recurring income and fixed-cost baselines, plus known quarterly and annual
  bills placed in the actual month they land rather than smeared evenly across
  the year. A balance chart and a table of upcoming non-monthly bills sit
  alongside the usual freshness bar; an account with no aggregated month or no
  net-worth snapshot yet sees an empty state rather than a zeroed-out forecast.
- **Advice on where unbudgeted money should go**
  ([#252](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/252)). A category can now
  be tagged `savings` or `investments` in Settings. Three new deterministic
  findings read that tag: unbudgeted money fills an emergency-fund shortfall
  from a tagged savings envelope first, routes what's left toward investments
  once the fund is covered, and a withdrawal well above a tagged envelope's
  usual baseline is flagged the same way an income change already is. None of
  this is ever written back to Actual.
- **A way to force a narrative rewrite** ([#226](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/226)).
  The insights page now offers a "Rewrite it anyway" control under a narrative
  that already exists and isn't stale, using the same price-then-confirm flow
  already used for writing the first review or refreshing a stale one.

### Fixed

- **A budget-amount proposal skewed low by the still-accumulating current month**
  ([#251](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/251)). The trailing average
  behind a proposed amount is now built only from finished months, so a partial
  month no longer sits in the average's 60%-weighted "recent" bucket dragging
  the suggestion down. Proposals are also now generated only for the current
  month — a closed month has nothing left to act on.
- **A narrative retry ceiling below the run's own cost estimate**
  ([#248](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/248)). The token ceiling
  used on a truncated narrative's retry sat below the estimate the cost guard
  itself assumes a narrative can need, so a retry that used exactly that much
  could still be cut off. The retry ceiling now tracks the same estimate.

## [0.10.8] — 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- **The monthly narrative sometimes cut off mid-sentence**
  ([#221](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/221)). Gemini's finish
  reason was only read when the response came back empty, so a non-empty
  answer truncated by the token ceiling was stored and rendered as if it
  were complete. A truncated call now retries once at double the ceiling;
  if it is still truncated, nothing is stored and the degraded banner
  reports it the same way as any other failed run, rather than showing an
  unfinished narrative as a finished one.

## [0.10.7] — 2026-09-05

### Added

- **An editable figure on budget-amount proposals**
  ([#220](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/220)). The amount #45's
  weighted trailing average proposes — or #217's note-driven nudge on top of
  it — is now a field the owner can edit before pressing apply, rather than
  only a binary accept/reject. An edited figure supersedes the pending
  proposal with a fresh one at the new amount; typing back the amount already
  budgeted rejects the proposal outright instead of erroring on "no change
  requested."
- **Owned property and its mortgage, tracked as their own kind of position**
  ([#227](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/227)). Any property held
  outright — a home lived in, a flat let out — with an optional mortgage whose
  outstanding balance amortizes forward from a principal, rate and remaining
  term set once at whatever point the owner's last statement was true, rather
  than typed in fresh every month. A property's equity nets into net worth the
  same way debt already does, and a rental adds its own net cash flow and
  gross yield. Deliberately outside the fund universe, drift table and
  rebalance engine — a paid-down room isn't a position either one can buy or
  sell to correct.
- **Insights, Budget and Portfolio split into section tabs**
  ([#228](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/228),
  [#230](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/230),
  [#229](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/229)), reusing the
  horizontal tab-strip component Settings (#200) introduced. Each page's
  freshness bar and any page-wide notices stay above the tabs since they
  qualify every section, not one; a bookmark to a specific tab's path lands
  directly on that section instead of at the top of a long scroll.

### Changed

- **The sign-out control moved to the bottom of the sidebar nav**
  ([#231](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/231)), out of the header,
  matching where the rest of the account-level chrome already lives.

## [0.10.6] — 2026-09-05

### Added

- **A running "what's coming up" note the budget-amount proposal can read**
  ([#217](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/217)). One owner-editable,
  free-text note on the settings page — a dentist bill, an annual renewal,
  anything the trailing average couldn't know about — plus an optional,
  owner-priced AI pass that reads it alongside #45's own budget-amount
  suggestions for the month and nudges only the category the note actually
  speaks to, bounded to three times the suggested amount either way. An empty
  note skips the model call entirely, at zero cost, and a nudge supersedes the
  proposal it adjusts rather than duplicating it.

## [0.10.5] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **A category guess for the transactions the deterministic path leaves behind**
  ([#216](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/216)). Below the payee-history
  confidence bar #45 already checks, a candidate is now kept in a per-month cache
  instead of dropped. The owner can select any of them from the Insights page,
  price a guess before anything is spent, and press it — never the nightly job on
  its own. The model sees only an opaque label per category a candidate's own
  history actually offers, never the payee's name or the transaction's id, and a
  guess outside that set is grounded away rather than trusted. What comes back is
  an ordinary `transaction_category.set` proposal through the queue and apply path
  #45 already built, not a new kind of decision.

## [0.10.4] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **The first person on the scale can now have a name** ([#215](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/215)).
  The household's "You" sentence reads with whatever the owner types into a
  plain text box beside the roster instead of a fixed placeholder. It stays
  outside the roster on purpose — no birth year, no custody share — and the
  equivalence scale keeps adding that person's weight unconditionally whether
  or not a name is set.

## [0.10.3] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **An approved proposal can now write to Actual** ([#45](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/45)).
  The nightly job proposes a category for an uncategorised transaction, drawn
  from what its payee has been filed under before, or a new budgeted amount for
  a category that has run over its trailing average for months running — no
  model call either way, both entirely deterministic. The owner applies or
  rejects either straight from the Insights page, one card at a time or as a
  batch; applying is the first thing Balancr has ever written back to Actual,
  gated behind ownership, audited, and idempotent so a retried apply is safe.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **The settings page is now a tab strip, not one long scroll**
  ([#200](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/200)). General, Prompts, Risk,
  Thresholds, Accounts, Benchmark and AI usage each get their own `/settings/*`
  route, so a bookmark or a reload lands back on the section it left rather than
  the top of everything.

### Fixed

- **Privacy mode's blur had two gaps left over from #171**
  ([#171](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/171)). Chart axis labels
  render as SVG text, not canvas, so a DOM filter reaches them the same as any
  other money figure — the budget-versus-actual and category-trend charts now
  blur their axes along with the net worth chart, instead of leaving a
  dollar-labelled scale exposed. The insights page's own AI-cost figures — a
  review's price, what a month has spent against its cap — were carved out as
  an AI-operational-cost exception meant for the settings page; they now blur
  like every other number on that page. Only the settings page's own AI-cost
  controls stay exempt.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **A privacy mode that blurs money on screen** ([#171](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/171)).
  A header toggle and a Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E shortcut apply a CSS blur to every money
  figure and holdings quantity — `<Money>`/`<Private>` mark the ones outside a small,
  enforced set of exceptions (AI-operational-cost figures, account configuration
  numbers). Hovering or focusing a figure peeks it; the choice persists across
  reloads. It is a shoulder-check, not a data boundary: the text underneath is
  unchanged, still selectable and still what a screen reader announces. Chart axis
  labels are canvas-drawn and stay outside the filter's reach except on the net worth
  chart, which blurs wholesale rather than leave its labelled trend line exposed.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **A sync run failed wholesale when a schedule's rule held a non-`set` action**
  ([#203](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/203)). Actual sends `field: null`
  for rule actions where a field genuinely does not apply — `link-schedule` and the
  like — rather than omitting the key, and `ruleShape`'s `field` was `.optional()`,
  which tolerates a missing key but not an explicit `null`. Every `getRules()` response
  with even one such action failed to parse, taking the whole sync job down with it.
  `field` is now `.nullable()` too, and `scheduleCategories` treats a null the same as
  an absent one.

### Added

- **A month's facts can change after it closes without the rest of the app quietly
  disagreeing with itself** ([#162](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/162)).
  `persistFacts` overwrote every month in the sync window unconditionally, but nothing
  recorded whether a pass actually changed anything — so the signals job, which only
  re-judges the last two months, and the AI analysis, which only re-runs for the same
  reason, had no way to notice a recategorisation from further back. A fingerprint over
  the facts a judgement actually depends on, stored per month as `facts_changed_at`,
  lets the signals pass re-judge exactly the months that moved instead of a fixed
  floor — for free, since the pass reads nothing but SQLite. The AI analysis stays
  opt-in: a changed past month is never re-run on its own, only marked stale for the
  owner to price and press.
- **The nightly AI pass no longer pays three times for an answer that cannot have
  moved** ([#160](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/160)). `CATCHUP_NIGHTS`
  re-runs the analysis for the same just-closed month on each of the first few nights
  of a new one, and every one of those calls used to cost the same as the first.
  `findReusableRun` now checks, before the budget gate, whether an identical call —
  same month, same redacted payload, same prompt version, same model — was already
  answered, and serves that stored answer for free as its own `reused` ledger row
  rather than asking Gemini again. A `force` flag on `POST /api/ai/refresh`, off by
  default so the nightly pass can never set it, calls anyway.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **The nightly signals job no longer crashes when two Statbel benchmark groups are
  over threshold in the same month** ([#198](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/198)).
  `above_benchmark` signals are household-level — one row per benchmark group (#43),
  with no category of their own — and the storage key collapsed every one of them onto
  the same row. A month with, say, both `transport` and `recreation` running hot at
  once violated the table's primary key and left that month unjudged.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- **Milestone `v0.9.0` closes without Actual-writing proposal handlers**
  ([#45](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/45)). The rest of the milestone —
  the Statbel benchmark, the shared-cost split, the schedule-aware spend projection, and
  the insights page's month picker — is done and on screen. #45 is a different kind of
  change from those four: every one of Balancr's writes so far has been to its own SQLite,
  and #45 is the first that would touch Actual's budget itself. Its own acceptance
  criteria ask for the read path to have "been trusted for a while" first, which a
  near-empty milestone is not a reason to shorten. It moves to the backlog rather than to
  a numbered milestone, since there is no fixed amount of read-path time that discharges
  the condition — it is a decision to make deliberately when it comes up again, not a
  deadline to schedule against.

## [0.8.5] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **A month picker on the insights page, the same one the budget page has had since
  `0.6.0`** ([#158](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/158),
  `src/server/routes/api/insights.ts`, `web/src/pages/Insights.tsx`). Reading what the
  analysis said about a past month meant whatever the last nightly run happened to cover,
  with no way to ask for July's after moving on — the two pages could disagree about what
  a month even meant. `GET /api/insights` now takes the same `?month=` the budget endpoint
  does, resolved through the same `resolveMonth`. Findings, the narrative and the run
  ledger narrow to the selected month, since each is stored under one; the clarification
  queue and the proposal review stay whole, since neither has a month of its own, and the
  page states as much next to each so a queue that ignores the control above it does not
  read as a bug.
- **A month with no review can be given one** (`src/domain/ai/narrative.ts`,
  `POST /api/ai/narrative`). Until now only the nightly job ever wrote a narrative, and
  only for the previous month, so a month with a capped or missing review had no way to
  get one after the fact. The endpoint is owner-only, priced first through
  `GET /api/ai/estimate?kind=narrative`, refuses a month that has not yet ended so a
  partial narrative is never cached forever, and answers the cached review for free on a
  second press.
- **The run ledger's `recentRuns` takes a `period`** (`src/domain/ai/runs.ts`), narrowing
  to one month plus every run about no month at all — a chat turn, or a call that failed
  before it knew which month it was for. Filtering it exposed a latent ordering bug: two
  runs recorded in the same millisecond broke ties differently depending on which query
  plan SQLite picked for the new `WHERE` clause. `recentRuns` now orders by `rowid` as a
  stable second key, so "newest first" no longer depends on an accident of the query plan.

## [0.8.4] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **How long a class has been outside its band, and a narrative that can say so**
  ([#183](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/183),
  `src/domain/advice/persistence.ts`). The portfolio page states today's drift: equities are
  at 85%, the ceiling is 75%, here is the trade that would close it. What no screen stated is
  that the same sentence was true in August and in July — and that is the difference between
  a market that moved and a rebalance nobody did. Balancr now reads the month-end metrics it
  has been storing all along, measures each one against the profile's current bands, and
  counts back from the newest: `drift_above_band` and `drift_below_band` fire once a class
  has been outside the same edge for three month ends, which is a setting.
- **The drift through the redaction boundary** (`src/domain/ai/redact.ts`). The payload gains
  a `drift` block — the profile, one line per asset class with its share, its band and the
  count, and the trades reduced to how many there were. No ISIN, no fund name, no position:
  the suggestions name an instrument to buy and the unmapped list is Ghostfolio's own string
  for something it could not classify, so both cross as integers. The golden denylist test
  covers the new fields, and the line is copied field by field rather than spread, so a
  field added to the portfolio page cannot arrive in a prompt by accident.
- **A narrative rule about the arithmetic it must not do** (`src/domain/ai/prompts.ts`). A
  share, a ceiling and a distance are three numbers where two would do, and a model that
  notices the third is a subtraction will eventually produce its own version of it. Rule 8
  states what a drift *is*: a decision the household has not acted on, of a length the data
  can support — and where few months have been observed, that the run is only as long as the
  history.
- **Improved built-in prompts now reach databases that already exist**
  (`SUPERSEDED_PROMPTS`). `seedPrompts` skipped any key that already had a version, so a
  better default reached new installs and nowhere else: every instance that had ever started
  up kept the first text forever, with nothing on any screen saying so. It now recognises the
  built-ins it has shipped before and, where the active version is one of them byte for byte,
  activates the new text as a *new version* — the old one stays readable, rollback still
  works, and a prompt anybody has edited is left alone.

### Fixed

- **Findings about a group or an asset class no longer collapse into one**
  (`src/domain/ai/redact.ts`, `src/domain/ai/analysis.ts`). A signal with no category id was
  sent to the model with no label at all, and the index the model's answer is resolved
  through keys on that label — so all ten benchmark-group findings shared one key: nine were
  unreferenceable and the tenth won at random. Two drifting asset classes would have hit the
  same wall. A signal that has no id but does have a name now sends the name, because in
  every such case it is a fixed id from a closed set rather than anything anybody typed.

### Changed

- **`GET /api/portfolio` and the AI bundle read the advice through one function**
  (`src/domain/advice/latest.ts`). The narrative's figures and the portfolio page's are now
  the same computation rather than two readings of the same snapshot, which is what makes
  "the figures match the portfolio page exactly" structural instead of a thing to check.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **A projection that knows what the month has already committed**
  ([#159](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/159),
  `src/domain/aggregate/committed.ts`). Rent leaves on the 28th, and until it does a burn
  rate built on elapsed time says one of two wrong things: on the 3rd it extrapolates one
  direct debit into ten, and on the 20th it reports an envelope as comfortable that has a
  €900 payment still to fall. Balancr now reads Actual's schedules, expands their
  recurrences over the days between today and month end, and states that figure separately:
  what is still to come per envelope, what has already gone, and how many occurrences each
  is. The budget page prints it beside what was spent, and the projection becomes
  `spent + still to come + the variable half extrapolated` — so a fully scheduled envelope
  is projected at exactly what it is scheduled for, and nothing is counted twice.
- **`committed_over_available`, a fifth overspend signal that fires before anything is wrong**
  (`src/domain/aggregate/overspend.ts`). €80 available and a €120 direct debit on the 28th is
  a problem on the 3rd of the month, when it can still be moved, and an `over_available` on
  the 29th, when it cannot. Capped at `warn` rather than `alert` for exactly that reason: the
  money is still in the envelope and nothing has been taken. Reported beside the other four
  and never folded into them, and silent under the same materiality floor — the €4,50
  shortfall that a rounding difference produces is true and not worth a line.
- **Actual's recurrence rules, reimplemented rather than approximated**
  (`expandOccurrences`). Every frequency Actual offers, its interval, its day-of-month and
  nth-weekday patterns, its three ending modes, and both weekend solve directions. Two
  behaviours are Actual's own and would each be a plausible bug the other way: a monthly
  schedule on the 31st has no occurrence in a 30-day month rather than being clamped to the
  30th, and 29 February in a common year is skipped without consuming one of the counted
  occurrences. A schedule solved backwards off a Sunday the 1st is paid in the previous
  month, and the expansion says so.
- **Schedules with no category count in the month total and in no envelope**
  (`src/domain/aggregate/committed.ts`, `GET /api/budget`). Actual attributes a schedule
  through the rule it owns, and a schedule whose rule sets no category is real money on a
  real date that belongs to nothing. Guessing an envelope for it would put a figure in a row
  that Actual will never agree with, so the month total carries it, states how many there
  are, and is stored rather than summed from the rows — a total that disagrees with its own
  rows needs to be the stored one, or the next reader will "fix" it.

### Changed

- **The schedule read is a privacy boundary, like every other Actual read**
  (`src/adapters/actual/queries.ts`). A schedule carries a payee, an account and the rule
  conditions that matched it — `NETFLIX INTERNATIONAL B.V.` among them — and Balancr's shape
  declares eight fields, none of which is any of those. Zod's strip does the removing, so a
  field Actual adds in a future version is dropped by default rather than surfacing in an AI
  payload, and `test/unit/actual-schedules.test.ts` asserts the returned object against a
  denylist built from a fixture's payees.
- **A schedule stating a range is counted at its upper bound**, and every screen that prints
  the figure says so. `Math.min` of the two bounds is the more negative one for an expense,
  which is the direction that cannot produce a pleasant surprise; the panel note names the
  assumption rather than leaving a figure looking exact.
- **The burn rate no longer projects the same rent four times**. Its inputs gained the
  committed figures, and the extrapolation now applies only to the part of the month's
  spending that was not scheduled. With nothing scheduled the arithmetic is exactly the old
  projection, which `test/unit/signals.test.ts` asserts across five month positions rather
  than trusting the algebra.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **What a cost shared with a co-parent actually costs you**
  ([#44](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/44),
  `src/domain/aggregate/custody.ts`). Paying the whole school bill in September is a 200%
  overrun against your own norm and roughly half of it was never economically yours. The
  budget page gained a card that says so: a row per flagged category with spending that
  month, largest first, carrying what you paid and your share of it, with a total that is
  the sum of the rows above it. Actual's figure is never adjusted — not in the table, not in
  the totals, not in the baseline a category is measured against — because what left the
  account is the only number that reconciles. Your share is an addition beside it, which is
  the same principle the benchmark card follows.
- **A shared-cost share, stated or derived from the roster**
  (`src/domain/benchmark/household.ts`, Settings → Household). Leave the box empty and the
  share is the average share of the time the part-time members of the household are here;
  full-time members are excluded, or a partner who lives here would pull it towards 100% and
  quietly make the feature do nothing. Type a number and that is used instead. `basis`
  travels with every split and every screen prints which of the two it was: who pays for the
  winter coat is negotiated separately from who has the children on Wednesday, so a derived
  share is Balancr guessing at an arrangement it has never seen. Empty is a value rather than
  an absence in the panel too — clearing the box is how a stated split is undone.
- **`custody_offset`, one finding for the household and never one per envelope**
  (`src/domain/ai/codes.ts`). Five flagged categories paid in one month would say the same
  thing five times, and the figure worth reading is the total, because it is what that
  month's overruns should be read against. Capped at `info` for the reason `above_benchmark`
  is — nobody has done anything wrong by paying a bill that gets split, and a `warn` would
  put a joint-custody household at the top of the insights page every month for the shape of
  its family — declared as good news, since it takes weight off an overrun rather than adding
  any, and silent under the same materiality floor as every other relative signal.
- **The split travels on the wire as a discriminated union, reasons included**
  (`GET /api/budget`). Three unavailabilities rather than a zero: no spending in the month,
  nothing flagged as shared, and nothing to derive a share from. The first two draw nothing
  at all — the flag is opt-in, and an empty month already has a notice of its own — while
  the third is the one worth a box, because the flags say somebody meant this to work. It
  carries the unsplit total so that box can name a figure.
- **A checkbox for `custody_shared`, so the split works with no Gemini key at all**
  (`PATCH /api/settings/categories/:id/custody-shared`, Settings → Categories). The flag had
  two writers before this and both needed a key: an approved `category_meta.set` proposal, or
  an answered `custody_shared_unknown` clarification. That made the split the one thing on
  the budget page an installation without AI could never switch on, and "AI is optional" is a
  requirement rather than a preference. It sits in the category table beside the COICOP
  picker because it is the same question asked of the same fifty rows, closed for income and
  hidden envelopes because the split skips both, and audited as `settings.custodyShared`
  against `category_meta` so a category's history reads as one list whether the flag came
  from a proposal or from a person.

### Changed

- **`computeSignals` takes the split as an input too**
  (`src/domain/aggregate/signals.ts`). Same arrangement as the benchmark comparison and for
  the same reason: the module is pure, and the split reads the category flags and a settings
  row. `jobs/signals.ts` loads both once per pass and hands the result in.
- **The benchmark mapping panel is now the category table**
  (Settings → Categories). Retitled because it no longer holds only the COICOP mapping, and a
  panel called "Benchmark mapping" with a co-parent checkbox in it is a panel whose name is
  one release out of date.
- **The household row now carries the cost share as well as the roster**
  (`PATCH /api/settings/household`). Written wholesale, like `members` — a patch that omits
  the share leaves a derived one behind rather than preserving a stated one, which is the
  safe direction of the two: a stated share silently surviving a roster edit is how somebody
  ends up reading a split they thought they had removed.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **A month's spending, compared with Belgian households**
  ([#43](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/43)). Your own twelve-month norm cannot
  answer "is €650 a month on food a lot", so the budget page gained the card that can.
  Statbel's Household Budget Survey publishes the share of its total an average household
  spends on each of ten lines; `config/statbel-benchmark.yaml` carries those shares with
  the survey, the year, a citation, the day somebody last checked them and a `status` per
  block, and `BENCHMARK_PATH` selects it. A path that does not exist removes the comparison
  and leaves every other figure untouched — not everybody wants an average held up against
  their spending. Nothing in the app can edit a share: a screen that let anybody type over
  the reference would be a screen that manufactures one, which is the single failure that
  would make the feature worse than its absence.
- **A COICOP division per category, and a thirteenth answer for what is not consumption**
  (`src/domain/benchmark/mapping.ts`, Settings → Benchmark mapping). The picker offers the
  twelve divisions the survey is classified against rather than the survey's ten lines,
  because three divisions share its "other expenditure" line and "other" would store a code
  nothing could later resolve; the line each division feeds is shown beside the choice
  instead. `00` is Balancr's own code for savings, investments, taxes, transfers and debt
  repayment: those are set aside from the comparison rather than counted at zero, since a
  budget holds plenty of them and counting them would make every real share look small. A
  stored code deeper than a division (`04.5.1`) is read at the division and shown as
  selected, so a category the comparison counts under housing can never read as unmapped.
- **An equivalence scale, with the one part of it that is Balancr's own labelled as such**
  (`src/domain/benchmark/household.ts`, Settings → Household). A single parent spends less
  than the average household and is not being frugal, so the reference is scaled by who
  lives here: the modified OECD scale out of the same file, 1,0 for the first person, 0,5
  per additional adult and 0,3 for a child under fourteen. Members are years of birth
  rather than "child" checkboxes — a checkbox is right on the day it is ticked and quietly
  wrong from the next birthday — and ages are taken as of the year being compared, so
  somebody who turned fourteen in March is a child in last January's figures. Custody is a
  share of the time per member, and prorating a weight by it is *not* something the
  published scale supports: `prorated` travels with the result and every screen that prints
  a prorated figure says the assumption out loud.
- **Two bases out of one file** (`src/domain/benchmark/compare.ts`). With only the shares
  transcribed the comparison is `mix` — how your month divides against how theirs does,
  stating that nothing in it claims you spend more than they do. Fill in the optional
  `reference_household` block and the same card becomes `level`, euro for euro, scaled to
  your household's size on the scale. Both carry the citation, the year, the verification
  date and the list of blocks nobody has confirmed at the source.
- **Two refusals, so a comparison is never a chart about the mapping**
  (`src/domain/benchmark/vocabulary.ts`). Under 70% of the month mapped nothing is drawn
  and the card says what to go and map: 100% would mean the feature never switches on
  because nobody maps every envelope, and 50% would mean a figure about the bookkeeping.
  A group with no reference share, a month with no spending and a month mapped entirely to
  `00` each come back as an explicit unavailability reason rather than as a zero.
- **`above_benchmark` emits at last, and can only ever be `info`**
  (`src/domain/aggregate/overspend.ts`). The fourth overspend signal was a stub returning
  nothing since `0.3.1`; it now fires per group above the reference by more than 20% *and*
  more than the shared materiality floor in euros. There is deliberately no opposite code:
  spending less than average on transport is what not owning a car looks like. The severity
  is capped in the payload rather than by convention, and `web/src/budget/benchmark.css`
  has no red cell to render a difference in — a household above the transport line has done
  nothing wrong, and neither has one below the restaurants line.

### Changed

- **`computeSignals` takes the comparison as an input** (`src/domain/aggregate/signals.ts`).
  The module is pure and the comparison reads a YAML file, a settings row and the category
  mapping, so `jobs/signals.ts` reads all three once per pass — none of them is a fact about
  a particular month — and hands the result in, the same arrangement `netWorth` already had.
- **The household roster is replaced whole, not merged**
  (`PATCH /api/settings/household`). Unlike the risk bands and the aggregation parameters:
  `members` is a list, and the only two gestures a form makes on a list are "here is the new
  one" and "remove a row". A merge cannot express the second.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **A risk profile, in numbers rather than an adjective**
  ([#41](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/41)). "Some risk, but not super high
  risk" cannot motivate a trade, so Settings → Risk profile is where it becomes twelve
  numbers: a floor, a target and a ceiling for equities, bonds, property and commodities,
  plus the two thresholds that decide when a drift is worth acting on at all. Three presets
  arrive with their own figures shown before anything is committed to, and they come from
  the server rather than being written out again in the browser — a second copy of
  "balanced" is a second definition of the profile the advice was computed against.
- **Editing a band makes the profile `custom`, and the panel says so as it happens**
  ([#41](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/41)). The profile in force is the
  numbers; the name is a label on them. So a hand edit sends the bands and no name, an
  untouched preset sends the name and no bands, and the two are mutually exclusive by
  construction. All four bands travel together, because four targets with one left over
  from the previous profile is precisely the state that adds up to 97%.
- **The drift from it, one row per band class, worst first**
  (`src/domain/advice/drift.ts`). Including the classes worth nothing: zero bonds against
  a 30% target is the most actionable row the page can draw, and a table built from what
  is held would leave it out entirely. Shares are of the *invested* value, which the
  caption states — cash at a broker is not an asset class, and on an instance whose
  Ghostfolio holds a synced bank balance measuring against the total would drop every
  class below its floor at once. A class Ghostfolio has and the profile has no band for
  comes back as `unmapped` with its share, never quietly folded into a neighbour.
- **A trade per class that left its band, carrying the figure that motivates it**
  (`src/domain/advice/suggest.ts`). #41 asks for no suggestion without its drift figure,
  so `Suggestion` holds the whole `DriftLine` it came from and cannot be constructed
  without it — the reason on the card and the row in the table are one function over one
  field rather than two paragraphs that can drift apart. A purchase may only name an
  instrument that came through `assertProposable`, so a class with no fresh fund in the
  universe produces a card saying which of the two reasons it is instead of a plausible
  ticker.
- **`funding`, because the size of a trade depends on where the money comes from**
  (`src/domain/advice/suggest.ts`). Buying from cash grows the base the share is a share
  of, so closing an apparent gap at a 65% target takes nearly three times the gap; when
  the same report also wants a sale, the two fund each other and the gap *is* the trade.
  Each suggestion states which case it is. One figure quoted for both would be wrong by a
  factor of three in whichever case it was not written for.
- **What acting would cost, from the tax module, on every card**
  ([#42](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/42) put to work). The same
  `describeTaxEstimate` a digest would call, so the estimate reads identically everywhere
  and the browser holds no second copy of the tax vocabulary. `taxOmits` is never empty on
  a sale: the realised gain needs a cost base this app never sees, and a total that
  quietly dropped it would read as complete.
- **A band outside its edge and left alone says which threshold suppressed it**
  (`skipped`). A red row with no suggestion under it is a bug report waiting to be filed,
  so the page names the threshold, the distance past the edge and the size of the trade —
  the three numbers needed to judge whether the threshold is set right.
- **Ghostfolio's class labels, per position** (`0012_old_rhino.sql`). `asset_class` and
  `asset_sub_class` on `portfolio_snapshots`: a sale has to name the position it would
  come out of, and the sub-class is what beurstaks turns on — 0,35% on a share against
  0,12–1,32% on a fund, so pricing every position as a fund overstates a share's exit by
  nearly four times. No backfill and no default: today's holdings are re-fetched every
  pass, and a historical row whose label was never recorded stays null and is simply not a
  candidate, which is the honest reading of "we do not know what this is".

### Changed

- **`GET /api/portfolio` computes the drift rather than reading it**
  (`src/server/routes/api/portfolio.ts`). The one exception to that route's rule, stated
  where it is broken: drift is a comparison against a profile the settings page can change
  at any moment, so a figure written by the nightly job would disagree with the bands on
  screen for up to a day. `portfolio_metrics.drift_json` stays null for the same reason.
  The profile, the fund universe and the tax rules are three cheap reads, each of which
  degrades to "no advice" rather than to a 500.
- **The tax wire types spell `| undefined` on their optional fields**
  (`src/domain/tax/estimate.ts`). JSON has one way to be absent and
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` has two, so a line parsed back out of the response schema
  was not assignable to the one function that has to run on both sides of the wire.
  Producers are unaffected. `UNKNOWN_REASONS` and `ASSUMPTIONS` became const arrays at the
  same time, so the response schema enumerates them from the domain rather than repeating
  them.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **What a trade actually costs, in euros, before it is made**
  ([#42](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/42)). The Belgian taxes on a concrete
  transaction: beurstaks on the way in and out, roerende voorheffing on a dividend, the
  Reynders levy on a bond fund's interest component, and the capital-gains tax that arrived
  in 2026. Every figure is computed in TypeScript from a dated rules file — the model is
  never asked for a rate and never asked for arithmetic.
- **Dated rulesets, selected by the transaction's own date**
  (`config/belgian-tax.yaml`, `src/domain/tax/rules.ts`). A sale in December 2025 is taxed
  under 2025's rules and one in January 2026 under 2026's, which is the difference between
  a €0 capital-gains bill and a real one. The shipped file carries both. A transaction
  before the oldest ruleset is refused rather than estimated, because the alternative is an
  estimate under rules that were not in force.
- **A `status` field instead of a disclaimer in a comment**
  ([#42](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/42)). Every rate carries the article it
  came from (`WDRT art. 1262`, `WIB92 art. 19bis`), the day it was last checked, and
  `status: confirmed | transcribed`. Everything shipped is `transcribed` — transcribed from
  published guidance, not verified against the law by anyone — and that field drives a
  sentence on screen naming the taxes in play, in both languages. A citation was chosen
  over a URL as the required field because an article number does not rot.
- **A range where a guess would be cheaper than the truth**
  (`src/domain/tax/estimate.ts`). Whether an accumulating fund pays 1.32% or 0.12%
  beurstaks turns on Belgian registration, which nothing in the ISIN, the domicile or the
  exchange reveals. Left unrecorded, the estimate reads "between € 1,20 and € 13,20" and
  never either end of it: falling through to the low fallback rate would understate the
  cost elevenfold, in the one direction that makes a trade look cheap. The same holds for a
  bond fund's interest component, which only the fund publishes — unknown reads as unknown,
  with a line saying what to go and find out.
- **A rules file that cannot answer "no rate found"** (`src/domain/tax/schema.ts`). Two
  structural refusals at load, each naming the tier and stating the fix: an instrument kind
  with no unconditional fallback tier, and a tier whose conditions are satisfied by
  everything below it, which can therefore never apply. Both are the failure mode where an
  edited file keeps working and starts being quietly wrong.
- **`fsma_registered` and `debt_claims_percent` on a fund universe entry**
  (`src/domain/universe/schema.ts`). Both optional, both replacing an inference rather than
  a default: the first decides the beurstaks tier, and the second replaces guessing a mixed
  fund's debt-claim share from its asset class — which the estimate records as an assumption
  on the line when it has to.
- **`TAX_RULES_PATH`** (default `./config/belgian-tax.yaml`). Unlike the fund universe, the
  default points at a real file inside the image, because nobody curates their own tax code
  — and there is deliberately no companion max-age variable: tax staleness is displayed on
  every line and in the startup log, and never enforced. A rate that changed last month,
  shown with the date it was last checked, still beats no estimate; CI proves the shipped
  file loads in the built image.
- **The glossary finally has a consumer** (`src/domain/tax/describe.ts`). Each line is
  named with the wording a Belgian broker statement uses — `Beurstaks (TOB)`,
  `Reynders-taks`, `Roerende voorheffing` — in the English UI too, and the catalogue is
  asserted to contain no percentage at all: a rate written into a translation is one the
  next government makes wrong, in the last place anybody looks. `formatBp` grew a
  `maxFractionDigits` option for the same reason, because 0,12% and 1,32% both round to
  one decimal and stop being eleven-fold apart.

### Changed

- **The YAML reader and the "not in the future" date are shared** (`src/yaml-file.ts`,
  `src/domain/verified-date.ts`), extracted from the fund universe rather than copied for
  the tax rules. The parts worth having twice are the ones that make a message fixable — a
  YAML error's line and column, the path in every sentence, and an empty file parsing to
  the value the caller meant rather than to a schema violation about a missing key.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **A curated fund universe: the only instruments advice may propose**
  ([#40](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/40)). A YAML file, written by the person
  whose money it is, read fresh on every use so an edit needs no restart. `assertProposable`
  is the only way to turn an ISIN into a fund a proposal may act on, and the same gate is
  exported as a Zod schema (`proposableIsinSchema`) so a payload type cannot be written that
  skips it — the alternative, a plain string field plus a call somewhere in a handler, is one
  refactor away from being forgotten. Absent file means empty universe means advice proposes
  nothing and says so at startup; a malformed file is a warning at boot and an exception at
  the point of use, because "the fund list was broken so I ignored it" is not a thing to do
  quietly when the next step is a trade.
- **ISIN check-digit validation**
  ([#40](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/40)). The only claim in a hand-written
  fund list that code can verify without a network. A transposed pair of characters is
  otherwise a valid-looking reference to a different instrument, and the refusal says which
  mistake it was — wrong length, wrong shape, or `ends in 4 but its check digit is 3` —
  because the fix differs and the reader has a KID in front of them.
- **Three rules the loader enforces, and a fourth that expires**
  ([#40](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/40)). Accumulating share classes only
  (a distributing one pays out dividends that Belgian roerende voorheffing taxes at 30%
  every year, which is a different decision and not an interchangeable one); EEA-domiciled
  UCITS only (the passport that means a KID exists and a Belgian broker can sell it — why
  `IWDA` qualifies and `VTI` cannot); `ter_percent` rather than `ter`, because a factor of a
  hundred in that field is invisible in every screen that shows it. And `last_verified`,
  which past `FUND_UNIVERSE_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (365) makes an entry unproposable rather than
  merely flagged — and leaves it out of what the model is shown at all, so a stale fund is
  never offered and then refused.
- **`FUND_UNIVERSE_PATH` and `FUND_UNIVERSE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`**
  ([#40](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/40)). The path defaults to
  `./config/fund-universe.yaml`, which nothing creates: `config/fund-universe.example.yaml`
  is a template of eleven accumulating UCITS funds that ships in the image beside it, and
  copying a template is not the same as having vetted it. Both values appear in the startup
  configuration summary, because "advice proposed nothing" is answered by one of them.
  `scripts/verify-image.sh` boots the built image pointed at the shipped template, so the
  file people copy out of the image is proven to parse under the schema as published.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Deployment hardening, verified rather than declared**
  ([#39](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/39)). Non-root, a read-only root
  filesystem, `cap_drop: ALL` and `no-new-privileges` were already in the Dockerfile and
  `compose.yaml` — as configuration, which is to say as claims. `scripts/verify-image.sh`
  now starts the built image with exactly those flags and asks the running container: is
  this uid non-root and is it `node`, does `/app` really refuse a write, does `/data`
  really accept one, is `CapEff` all zeroes, is `NoNewPrivs` set, do both native modules
  load, and does the image's own `HEALTHCHECK` command work — a broken one makes Docker
  restart a healthy container every interval, forever. CI runs it on every image build.
  Runnable by hand, which is why it is a script rather than workflow YAML.
- **Egress restricted to the hosts this deployment is configured for**
  ([#39](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/39)). `EGRESS_MODE=enforce` by
  default: a connection to anything that is not Actual, Ghostfolio, the OIDC issuer or
  Google's Gemini endpoint is refused, and the host is logged. The allowlist is derived
  from the same `.env` values the adapters read, so it cannot drift from the
  configuration — moving Ghostfolio to a new hostname needs no second edit. `warn` allows
  and logs instead, which is how you see what a newly added dependency wants before
  deciding whether it should have it; `EGRESS_EXTRA_HOSTS` covers an outbound proxy. A
  denial logs the host and never the path or query, because on an exfiltration attempt
  the query string is the data. What it defends against is a dependency rather than a
  network: it wraps global `fetch`, so it covers the Ghostfolio adapter, the Gemini SDK
  and `openid-client`, and it does not cover a library reaching for `node:http` directly,
  a native module, or a child process — stated plainly in `src/egress.ts` rather than
  oversold, and the reason the network-level rule is still worth having.
- **The mode of `.env` is checked at every start**
  ([#39](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/39)). One line if the file holding the
  Actual password, Ghostfolio token, Gemini key, session secret and backup passphrase is
  group- or world-readable, naming the mode and the command that fixes it. A warning, not
  a refusal. Silent in a container, where compose reads `.env` on the host and there is
  no such file to have a mode.
- **Image size and startup time recorded in the job summary**
  ([#39](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/39)) — 410 MB and one second to the
  first `/healthz` on amd64 today — with ceilings a little above those. Not targets:
  tripwires, so a change that doubles either has to be a deliberate edit to the script
  rather than something nobody noticed.

### Fixed

- **The runtime prune understood one of the two prebuild layouts, and shipped seven
  unloadable binaries per image** ([#39](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/39)).
  `scripts/prune-runtime-deps.mjs` handled `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>/` directories,
  which is what `argon2` ships, and not flat `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>.node` files,
  which is what `better-sqlite3` 13 ships — so every image up to this one carried all
  eight of its platform binaries, including Windows and macOS. Vendored C sources go too:
  10 MB of SQLite amalgamation per copy of `better-sqlite3`, read only by `node-gyp` at
  install time, and there are three copies. Seventy megabytes in total. The pruner also
  takes the target architecture as an argument now instead of assuming amd64, because the
  same bug in reverse deletes the only binary an arm64 build can load, and it refuses to
  leave a native package with no binary at all rather than letting that surface as a
  container that will not start. All of it covered by
  `test/unit/prune-runtime-deps.test.ts`, which asserts what survives as well as what
  goes: deleting too little was silent for six milestones.

## [0.6.4] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Nightly encrypted backups, and a restore that has been performed rather than
  assumed** ([#38](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/38)). Almost everything in
  the database is recomputed from Actual and Ghostfolio by morning; what is not is the
  part you typed — every category description, COICOP code and sensitivity flag built up
  by answering questions about your own budget, plus the prompt versions and the cost
  ledger. `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` switches it on and is the only flag there is: empty means
  off, which is the right setting when the volume is already covered elsewhere. Each
  night, last in the job order so it captures that night's work, the database is copied
  with `VACUUM INTO` — through SQLite, rather than a file grabbed from underneath a live
  WAL — and encrypted with AES-256-GCM under a scrypt-derived key, header authenticated
  as associated data so the cost parameters cannot be edited into a denial of service.
  `/data/actual` is excluded: it is a cache of a budget the Actual server still holds.
  `BACKUP_DIR` defaults inside the one volume, with the limit that implies stated in the
  README rather than left to be discovered.
- **`npm run backup:verify`**, which answers the question a nightly job cannot answer
  about itself: that the passphrase in `.env` today is the one those files were written
  with, that they decrypt, and that what comes out is this deployment's data and not an
  empty schema. It decrypts into a private temp directory, runs `PRAGMA integrity_check`,
  counts eight tables and deletes the copy — safe against production.
- **`npm run backup:restore`**, which exists because the format is Balancr's own and no
  `openssl` incantation opens one of these files. It verifies the snapshot in full
  *before* anything moves, so a wrong passphrase or a damaged file fails while the live
  database is still in place, and it never deletes: the database being replaced is
  renamed to `balancr.db.pre-restore-<stamp>`, `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars moved with it.
  The README documents the procedure; `test/unit/backup-restore.test.ts` runs it on every
  test run, including the refusals, asserting each time that the target was left
  byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **`backup` on the refresh control**, for taking a copy by hand before doing something
  risky. Retention is deliberately not fooled by that: a file is deleted only when it is
  both older than `BACKUP_KEEP` days *and* surplus to `BACKUP_KEEP` files, so a manual
  backup never evicts a scheduled one, and an instance switched off for a month does not
  come back and delete its own history for being old.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **The AI layer is optional, and an instance without it says so instead of refusing
  to start** ([#165](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/165)). `vertex` is the
  default provider and needs `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, so a copied `.env.example` with
  the Gemini block untouched could not boot at all — a paid dependency demanded of
  someone who wanted the budget figures. Missing credentials now switch the model off
  silently; only a *contradiction* is still refused, where the provider names one
  credential and the other one is the one that is set. `AI_ENABLED` is the second half:
  a way to pause spending without editing a key out of `.env` and back in.
- **One reason code, five surfaces.** `aiAvailability()` distinguishes no credential,
  `AI_ENABLED=false` and a budget of zero, in that order of precedence, and it reaches
  the pages on `/api/insights` and `/api/settings` as a code rather than a sentence, so
  both catalogues carry the wording. The insights page prints what is missing, what is
  unaffected — the signals, the burn rate, the net worth, none of which ever involved a
  model — and the one line of `.env` that changes it. The three sections only a model
  can fill are dropped rather than printing their own "nothing pending yet", which on a
  deployment without a key is a lie by omission; anything already stored still renders,
  because switching the model off is not a reason to throw away last month's narrative.
- **The two controls that spend money check first.** The by-hand analysis and the prompt
  editor's test run explain the state in place of their button, rather than discovering
  the refusal by being pressed. The prompt editor otherwise stays fully usable: writing
  and versioning the instructions is worth doing before buying a key.

### Changed

- **The nightly AI pass reports `ok` with a reason instead of failing.** An instance
  that never bought a key does not want a red job row every night for a dependency it
  deliberately does not have, and the ops row names the variable to change rather than
  saying "0 findings" for the third night running. The three paid endpoints answer
  `409` with the reason spelled out — not `503`, which would invite a retry of a request
  that will fail identically until someone edits `.env`.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **Context caching is no longer asked for at a size it cannot be granted**
  ([#121](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/121)). Google will not cache a
  context below 1024 tokens. Balancr's system prompts are 453 and 589 tokens, so every
  process start spent a failed `caches.create` per model to rediscover that, and wrote
  `context caching unavailable` into the log of a system that was working exactly as
  designed.

  The minimum is now a local rule rather than a discovered error: the instruction's
  token count is estimated before the call and the create is skipped when it is plainly
  short, logged once at debug as a statement of fact. The estimate deliberately
  over-states English prose — three characters per token against a real four — because
  the two errors are not symmetric: guessing high can only make Balancr attempt a create
  the provider then refuses, which is one round trip and the old behaviour, while
  guessing low would silently skip a cache that would have worked. The provider stays
  the authority, and a create that is attempted and rejected still falls back to sending
  the instruction inline.

  The mechanism stays. The fund universe ([#40](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/40))
  is what caching was built for and what will push the prompt past the floor, at which
  point this check stops firing and nothing else changes.

### Added

- `GEMINI_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS` (default `1024`). Google changing the floor becomes a
  config edit rather than a release, and `0` disables the check entirely — ask, and take
  the provider's answer.


## [0.6.1] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Refresh on demand, all of it or one source**
  ([#122](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/122)). Until now the only way to
  make a figure current was to wait for the schedule or restart the container. Every
  page already says how old its numbers are; this puts the control next to the
  sentence, and each page starts only the jobs whose figures it shows — the budget
  page does not wait through a Ghostfolio download to re-read a category total.

  `POST /api/refresh` takes no body for "everything the figures come from" — `sync`,
  `portfolio`, `networth`, `signals` — or `{"jobs":[…]}` for a subset. **Selective
  refresh runs the dependents rather than leaving them behind**: `sync` also runs
  `networth` and `signals`, because a budget re-read that left net worth computed
  from the previous one would make the two halves of the overview disagree. The
  response separates `requested` from `accepted`, and the screen names the
  difference — *"Net worth, Signals ran as well"* — so nothing moves unexplained. An
  empty array and an unknown job name are both rejected; neither is quietly read as
  "all of them".

  **`ai` is refused by name**, with a `403` that says where its control is. It is
  the one job that spends money, and a page-level "refresh everything" that quietly
  called Gemini would be a button with a price the reader cannot see. It has an
  endpoint of its own — `POST /api/ai/refresh`, owner-only, in the strict AI bucket —
  and a control of its own on the settings panel that already prints what the month
  has cost: priced first from `GET /api/ai/estimate`, then confirmed with the amount
  in the button's own label. Over budget it stays pressable on purpose, because the
  cost guard's documented answer is a cached result with a banner and the endpoint is
  the single place that decides.

  **One refresh at a time, and "running" is not read from a row.** A second request
  answers `409`; what makes that answer safe is that in-flight work is tracked in the
  process, so a `running` row left behind by a crash blocks nothing after a restart.
  Every start is audited as `jobs.refresh` with the actor and the job names, which the
  `jobs` table cannot record — it holds one row per job, overwritten by every run.

  On screen, progress is **read from the job rows rather than timed**. "Refreshed" is
  said only once every accepted job has a row newer than the request, where a row
  still marked `running` and a job with no row at all both count as unfinished — the
  first because `runJob` writes `lastRunAt` when a job *starts*, the second because a
  queued job has not written one yet. After a minute of waiting the bar stops polling
  and says the job is still going, which is the honest thing to say about a first sync
  over two years of history, and hands the button back. Where the scheduler is
  switched off there is no button at all, since the endpoint would answer `403`.

### Changed

- A fourth rate-limit bucket, thirty an hour, in front of the refresh routes. The
  concurrency question is already answered by the `409`; this is about the client that
  starts one the instant the last finished, since every accepted refresh reaches into
  someone else's Actual and Ghostfolio and can starve the nightly pass without ever
  overlapping itself.
- `buildApp` takes the job registry as an option, defaulting to the real one. An HTTP
  test of the refresh endpoint would otherwise dial Actual and Ghostfolio to assert
  something about a `202`.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **The insights page — findings, the narrative, both queues, and the ledger of
  every call** ([#32](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/32)). The last of
  the five views, and the one that had to show its own workings: it renders what a
  model concluded about a month, so it also renders every call that was made and
  exactly what went out in each one. The five sections are in that order on purpose
  — conclusions, then the reasoning, then what is still being asked, then what is
  being proposed, then the evidence.

  Findings are grouped by severity with the worst group first, and the grouping
  comes from `SEVERITY_RANK` rather than an order written out a second time, so the
  page cannot disagree with the ranking the server kept findings by. Severity is
  carried by the group heading and the sentence, not by colour alone. A code this
  bundle has no sentence for, or a signal missing the metric its sentence
  interpolates, is **dropped** rather than printed as a bare code or as a sentence
  with a hole in it — a finding that cannot be stated is not a finding.

  The narrative is inserted as HTML, which is worth stating plainly: `util/markdown.ts`
  escapes the model's text *first* and only then emits a fixed list of tags, none of
  which take attributes, so there is no `href`, `src` or `style` for a payload to
  hang an injection on. It has to happen on the server anyway, because the stored
  Markdown says `c7` where a category name belongs and only the server can resolve
  the label. The byline names the model beside the date, so last night's analysis is
  distinguishable from one written three weeks ago by a model since swapped out.

  Both queues are read-only in this version and **say so on screen** rather than
  implying it by the absence of buttons: answering a clarification re-analyses the
  month and applying a proposal writes an audit row, and both belong to
  [#43](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/43)–[#45](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/45).
  Shipping the queues before the buttons is deliberate — the queue is what tells you
  the analysis is asking about the right categories, and that is worth reading early.
  Clarification cards show the model's guess rather than an open question, with the
  materiality share beside it so the threshold is legible instead of mysterious.

  The ledger is the privacy claim made checkable from a browser instead of from a
  SQLite prompt on the host. Every attempt is a row, `capped` and `blocked`
  included, because those are the answers that are *missing* from the page above; a
  failed run shows the upstream message verbatim, the only text on the screen
  Balancr did not write. The payload is fetched when a row is opened, not with the
  page — twenty redacted bundles would be most of `/api/insights`, downloaded on
  every visit to render a list of dates and costs — and one row is open at a time.
  A payload that will not parse says so as a note, not as an error: the row around
  it is still true, and that is the audit view reporting a finding about itself.

### Changed

- `GET /api/insights` now carries `model` on the narrative object, for the byline.
- `web/src/pages/Placeholder.tsx` is `PageHeader.tsx`, and the placeholder itself is
  gone along with the `page.*.soon` strings: all five pages render their own content
  now, so a component whose job was to say "coming next" has no callers.
- `.badge` moved out of `settings.css` into `theme/components.css`, now that a
  second page labels a status with it.

## [0.5.20] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Readiness, a probe that actually runs, and job state on screen**
  ([#37](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/37)). Three questions that were
  being asked of one endpoint now have one endpoint each. `/healthz` stays liveness
  and touches nothing — the container health check reads it, and restarting Balancr
  because Ghostfolio is restarting turns one outage into two. `GET /readyz` is the
  new one: should traffic be routed here. `GET /api/status` is the same computation
  with the detail attached, and it needs a session.

  The split is on the disclosure boundary, not on convenience. `/readyz` is
  unauthenticated because a health check cannot hold a cookie, so it carries names
  and verdicts and nothing else: `{name, status}` per check, and no `reason`. The
  detail — `connect ECONNREFUSED 172.19.0.4:5006`, the Ghostfolio path whose shape
  changed, the upstream's own error text — is an internal hostname, an internal
  port and a version fingerprint, and it is behind the session on `/api/status`.
  There is a test that projects both payloads and asserts the exact key set of
  each, so a field added to the status type cannot reach `/readyz` by being
  forgotten.

  **The capability probe now runs on a schedule instead of only at startup.** It
  was a function nothing called after boot, which meant a Ghostfolio upgrade at
  10:00 was discovered by the next aggregation producing wrong numbers. It is a
  job now, with its verdict and per-path report in a new `upstream_probes` table,
  so readiness can report a shape mismatch without calling Ghostfolio on every
  request. The failing report is written *before* the job throws — a probe that
  fails and leaves no trace is the one case the table exists to prevent.

  An unprobed upstream reads "not known", never "ok". Claiming an upstream is
  healthy because no probe has ever contradicted it is the answer worth refusing:
  a fresh deployment that has never run a job looks exactly like a healthy one
  from the inside.

  On screen, a sixth settings panel: the four checks with their reasons, every
  job with last run, last success, next run, duration and schedule, and the
  probe's per-path report. It fetches `/api/status` itself rather than reading the
  settings payload, because readiness decays while the page is open and because it
  has to be able to be the thing that failed while the rest of the page loaded —
  the build block below it stays on the settings payload for the same reason in
  reverse, so the version and revision are still on screen when `/api/status` is
  what is broken.

  Two Ghostfolio failures are drawn differently on purpose. Unreachable is amber:
  transient, and the figures on the page are still the last correct ones.
  A shape mismatch is red, because nothing but a new Balancr fixes it. Verdicts
  with nothing wrong yet — `unknown`, `idle` — get no colour at all; a first boot
  that looked like a fault would send someone hunting for one.

  Upstream text is quoted rather than translated, in a monospace `<q>`, because
  `connect ECONNREFUSED 172.19.0.4:5006` is a string to search for and a
  translated paraphrase of it is not. Everything Balancr says itself is in both
  languages.

## [0.5.19] — 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **One set of instructions for the assistant, not one per language**
  ([#133](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/133)). The prompts were seeded
  under every supported locale, which made the locale fallback in `resolvePrompt`
  unreachable and turned an edit into a silent half-change: tightening the rule
  "never state a figure you were not given" in English left the Dutch copy of that
  rule exactly as it was, with nothing on screen saying so. They are now stored
  once, under a `'*'` sentinel that means every language, and the reply language is
  what it always was — a separate directive appended to every run, naming the
  language rather than passing a bare code.

  The sentinel rather than a nullable column, because both unique indexes on
  `prompts` include `locale` and SQLite treats `NULL`s in a unique index as
  distinct — so nullable would have quietly allowed two active shared versions of
  the same prompt. There is a test that the index still refuses the second one.
  It also means the change needs no schema migration at all: `locale` was already
  `text not null`.

  A language can still diverge, and doing so is now a deliberate act with a button
  behind it rather than the default state. Writing a version for one language forks
  the text on screen into it and is what puts that language in the editor's picker;
  going back is `deactivateOverride`, which switches the override off without
  deleting anything, so its versions stay readable and activating one is the way
  back. The editor says which of the three texts is in the box — this language's own
  version, the shared text, or the built-in constant — because someone who opens a
  Dutch prompt, sees English, and saves an edit would otherwise have created a
  Dutch version out of the shared one without being told.

  Migration `0010_shared_prompt_locale.sql` collapses an existing install, and
  deliberately only where it is provably safe: a key whose rows are all one body at
  one version is the untouched seed, so the duplicates are dropped and the survivor
  is renamed to `'*'`. A key whose languages have already diverged is left entirely
  alone — no edit is destroyed and no language is promoted to speak for the rest —
  and `seedPrompts` then writes the shared row it will fall back to, which leaves a
  partly-diverged install in a state that is visible in the editor and fixable
  there. Both behaviours have tests that replay the shipped SQL rather than a
  paraphrase of it.

  One consequence worth stating: the priced test run no longer sends a `locale`
  when the shared prompt is what is being tested. `promptId` already pins the text,
  so the field only chose which language the findings came back in, and the shared
  prompt has no language of its own to ask for. The server answers in the reader's,
  which is what the nightly job would do for them.

### Fixed

- **`node_modules` is no longer tracked as a symlink into one machine's home
  directory.** The v0.5.18 release commit committed it as a link whose target is an
  absolute path on the author's laptop — pointing, as it happens, at itself. Any
  checkout of that commit replaces a real `node_modules` with a self-referential
  link, and everything resolved through it then fails with `ELOOP`: `npm run` cannot
  spawn a script, `node_modules/.bin/tsc` cannot be read, and the whole local gate
  stops working while reporting nothing but exit code 194. Diagnosing it means
  reading `~/.npm/_logs`, because no message names the cause.

  `.gitignore` did not stop it: `node_modules/`, with the trailing slash, matches a
  directory and not a symlink of the same name, so `git add -A` picked it up the
  moment the link existed. The pattern now has no slash and covers both.

  **The v0.5.18 tag and its published release still carry the symlink** — a tag is
  a promise about a commit, and re-cutting one that people may already have fetched
  trades a bounded problem for an unbounded one. A fresh clone at `v0.5.18` needs
  `unlink node_modules && npm ci` before anything else will run; `v0.5.19` and later
  are clean. Removing it from the index does not touch a working copy that has a
  real `node_modules`.

  A new test refuses the whole class rather than this one path: `git ls-tree -r HEAD`
  must contain no mode-`120000` entry, and nothing named `node_modules` at any depth.
  The gate could not have caught this on its own, because the thing that broke was
  the gate.

## [0.5.18] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **A contrast check in the gate, and it derives its pairs from the stylesheets**
  ([#35](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/35)). `npm run contrast:check`
  reads every rule under `web/src`, measures each foreground against its stated
  background, and fails under 4.5:1 for text or 3:1 for a border, a plotted shape
  or the focus ring — in both themes. A hand-kept list of pairs was the obvious
  design and the wrong one: it goes stale the moment a component is styled, and it
  describes pairs the cascade never renders. The first version of this check was
  written against such a list and named a pair that does not exist, which is how
  the design changed.

  A rule that sets only `color` inherits a background no stylesheet can name, so
  the token is measured against all four surfaces the layout paints large areas
  with. That is the strict reading, and it is the one that found the real defect:
  a grey that clears the white card and fails the slightly darker page behind it.

  Every pair is printed with its measured ratio and its remaining margin, on
  success as well as failure. That is not decoration — it is what showed three
  pairs passing by 0.01 after the first round of fixes, which is a floor met and
  no headroom, so the values were recomputed to sit clear of it. The tightest pair
  in the palette now passes by 0.25.

- **The holdings table's scroll box is a named region.** Six columns of figures
  cannot reflow onto a phone, so the box takes `tabIndex={0}` and is the only way
  to reach the right-hand columns without a pointer. That makes it a focus stop,
  and a focus stop with no role and no name announces itself as nothing at all. It
  is now a `region` labelled by the same `<caption>` that names the table — one
  accessible name, stated once, reached two ways.

### Changed

- **`--border-strong` and `--chart-axis` are repainted to clear the floor.** The
  input border sat at 1.54:1 against its own fill and 1.78:1 against the card in
  dark, where 3:1 is the requirement for the edge that tells someone where a text
  box is. Chart axis labels are text and sat at 4.28:1. Both keep their hue and
  saturation and lose only lightness, so the palette reads as it did.

- **`--text-faint` is gone, and the four places that used it for text use
  `--text-muted`.** A validation message, a version string, a diff's line numbers
  and a sign-in separator — all of them informational, all of them under 4.5:1 on
  the page behind them. Darkening the token to clear every surface produced
  `#636b77`, which is indistinguishable from `--text-muted` at `#5a6373`, so there
  was no third tier to keep: a grey light enough to read as faint is a grey under
  the floor. Quieter is now done with size, which is what the settings stylesheet
  already said about disabled controls — change the background, keep the text
  colour, because a viewer has to be able to read the thresholds they cannot
  change.

## [0.5.17] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **The duplicate-account panel now says what it found, and a "no" now sticks**
  ([#131](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/131)). It used to offer every
  Ghostfolio account against every non-checking Actual account, so an instance with
  five unrelated accounts — a meal-voucher card, two eco-cheque balances, some cash and
  a savings account — read as a wall of suggestions pairing things that have nothing to
  do with each other, with no way to say so.

  Each pair is now scored on four signals: the same name once punctuation and case are
  normalised, one name containing the other as whole words, balances that agree to
  within €1 or 0.1%, and a matching currency. At least one signal must be something
  other than currency, only the best match per Ghostfolio account is offered, and a
  cash account is never crossed with a portfolio — the account kind derived in
  [#124](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/124) is what makes that possible,
  including the direction the old filter structurally excluded: a broker balance mirrored
  into an *on-budget* Actual account.

  Balances are compared signed and only when both sides are non-zero. Zero is the most
  common balance in any dataset, so treating it as evidence would pair every empty
  account with every other one, and a credit card at −800 is not the same money as a
  savings account at +800.

  The reason travels with the suggestion, so the panel reads "Suggested because: both
  are called the same thing and the balances agree" instead of asking you to work out
  what it saw. And **Not the same money** records the answer permanently — against the
  account rather than against the pair, because a pair is identified by two names and
  the next sync that renames either side would resurrect the suggestion. It reuses the
  decided-fields ledger from #132, so a dismissal is an ordinary human decision that
  no derived rule may overturn, and it is audit-logged like any other.

## [0.5.16] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **The interface's language is decided in one place now, and the document says
  which one it is** ([#34](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/34)). The
  resolution order — the signed-in account's own setting, then a `balancr_locale`
  cookie, then a q-weighted `Accept-Language`, then `DEFAULT_LOCALE`, every rung
  filtered against `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` — lives in `src/server/locale.ts` and is
  called by exactly two things: the SPA shell and `/bootstrap`. So `<html lang>`
  and the language the bundle starts in are one answer, not two implementations
  that agree until they don't. The browser's own `navigator.languages` walk is
  gone, which is what makes that true rather than merely intended.

  The account's setting can be the first rung even on a public route because the
  auth `preHandler` populates `request.user` for every request carrying a valid
  session, including the routes declared `auth: false`. A signed-in visitor's
  first paint is therefore in their language, before any JavaScript has run.

- **`<html lang>` is now the language on the page.** One shell document per
  supported locale is built at startup and held in memory, so a request picks a
  string rather than rewriting HTML. The attribute is rewritten, not templated
  from a `{{lang}}` placeholder, so `web/index.html` stays a document the dev
  server can serve — and a bundle with no `<html lang>`, or two of them, is a
  startup error naming the file instead of a page that renders the placeholder.
  The shell carries `Vary: accept-language, cookie` beside its `no-store`, so
  the first visitor's language cannot become everyone's in a cache that ignores
  the one and honours the other.

  This is what a screen reader reads to pick a pronunciation, and it is why
  `hyphens: auto` breaks `Instellingen` where Dutch breaks it.

- **A `balancr_locale` cookie, with the server as its only writer.** It is set on
  local login, on the way through the OIDC callback, and when the profile patch
  changes the column — a cache of the account's `locale`, never an independent
  opinion, which is why it is `httpOnly`. Without it the reload after a language
  change would render `lang="en"` around a page of Dutch strings, and a first
  visit after login would arrive in the browser's language rather than the
  account's.

- **`bootstrap.locales.active`** — the language the server resolved, so the
  client initialises i18next with the answer it was given.

- **`npm run i18n:check` now refuses a translation longer than its box.**
  Thirteen bounds over the nav labels, the buttons that share a row, the
  bullet-chart legend and every group rendered as a badge or a pill, each naming
  the box it has to fit. The check exists because the layout below was sized for
  Dutch by hand, and hand-sizing rots the moment someone adds a key.

### Changed

- **The chrome is sized for the longer language.** Nav labels reserve two lines
  unconditionally so the icons stay on one baseline whichever language is
  showing, and the bullet chart reserves two rows for its legend: Dutch's
  `Toegewezen` / `Uitgegeven` / `12-maandsgemiddelde` is 39 characters against
  English's 26, and ECharts lays the legend over the grid, so an unplanned second
  row lands on the axis labels rather than pushing them down.

- **The application follows the account's language once the session says what it
  is**, tracked by the locale it has already acted on rather than by the language
  currently showing. Comparing against the current language would have meant the
  settings control appeared to do nothing: the session payload is stale the
  instant the control switches the language, so an effect reading it would put
  the interface straight back.

## [0.5.15] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **Net worth no longer counts bank cash twice** on an instance where a tool syncs bank
  accounts into Ghostfolio as well as Actual
  ([#124](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/124)). On the reporting instance
  that was roughly a third of the total, entered once from each source, and labelled
  invested — so the emergency-buffer figure and the allocation were both wrong in the
  same direction at the same time.

  Ghostfolio can already tell the two kinds of account apart, so the classification is
  derived rather than asked for. Two independent signals, and either one firing is
  enough: orders recorded against the account, and a value exceeding the balance — both
  taken in the base currency, because comparing a converted value against an
  unconverted balance reads a foreign-currency cash account as a portfolio purely
  because of the exchange rate. On the reporting instance the signals agree unanimously
  across seven accounts, six cash and one portfolio.

  The asymmetry is deliberate. A false "investment" costs a label on a settings page; a
  false "cash" is what gets an account grouped away as a duplicate, and money missing
  from net worth has no symptom. So an account the instance says nothing about stays
  `investment`, and an empty account reads as cash only because nothing is at stake
  until the first trade.

  Each Ghostfolio cash account is then grouped with the Actual account of the same
  name, Actual being the side that counts because that is where the account is
  reconciled against statements. The matcher is unwilling on purpose: one Actual row and
  one Ghostfolio cash row sharing a normalised name, or no pair at all. Two accounts
  called "Spaarrekening" produce nothing, because a total that is too small looks
  exactly like a total that was always that size, while the double count announces
  itself as a number that is too big. Ghostfolio cash with no twin keeps counting —
  excluding it wholesale would be right here and would silently lose the money on a
  deployment where a bank exists in Ghostfolio only.

  Both writes go through the derived path added in 0.5.14, so a person's answer wins
  permanently: ungrouping a pair is a decision, and the next sync leaves it alone rather
  than regrouping what was just taken apart.

- **The allocation chart is a picture of what the money is invested in**, not of the
  account total. Ghostfolio reports the broker's cash balance as a `LIQUIDITY` holding,
  which put "Cash" beside "Equities" as though it were a position someone chose — and on
  an instance holding six mirrored bank balances, that slice was most of the pie.
  `portfolio_metrics` now carries the total split into `invested_value_cents` and
  `cash_value_cents`, the portfolio page names both halves so the slices reconcile
  against the headline figure, and the split crosses to Gemini as well, because the
  reported return is over the whole total while the allocation covers only part of it.
  Rows written before the columns existed read as "not known": the split is not
  recoverable from one number, and filling it in would claim a cash balance was
  invested on exactly the rows that made the fix necessary.

## [0.5.14] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Every `account_map` row now records which of its fields a person decided**, so a
  derived classifier can improve a guess without erasing an answer
  ([#132](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/132)). `kind` said `savings` and
  nothing distinguished a rule having said so from a person having said so, which made
  the classifier #124 needs unbuildable: `defaultKind` runs only on insert, so it can
  never reach an existing account, and a version that re-derived unconditionally would
  have silently reinstated the six accounts held out of net worth by hand — overstating
  net worth with nothing on the chart saying why.

  Four fields are decidable — `kind`, `includeInNetWorth`, `dedupeGroup` and
  `isSourceOfTruth` — and naming one in a settings write marks it decided, including
  when the value chosen matches what a rule would have produced: confirming a guess has
  to be worth more than never looking. Grouping, choosing a source of truth and
  ungrouping all record themselves too, and choosing a winner marks the whole group,
  because deciding one row is the source is simultaneously deciding the others are not.

  Derived writes go through `applyDerivedFields`, which skips every decided field, does
  *not* claim the fields it does write, and stamps `classified_at` even when it changed
  nothing — "the rule looked and had nothing to add" and "the rule has never run" are
  different states, and only the timestamp separates them.

  The migration infers provenance for existing rows from the only evidence there is: a
  stored value that differs from what the insert-time default would have produced. It is
  deliberately conservative, so it can under-report a decision but never invent one —
  under-reporting costs a re-derivation that agrees with the person anyway, while
  over-reporting would freeze a row against every future improvement. An Actual account
  still reading `checking` or `other` stays undecided on purpose: those are the vague
  ones a better classifier exists to sharpen.


## [0.5.13] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Both charts now start where the data starts, not where the install does**
  ([#114](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/114)). `net_worth_snapshots` and
  `portfolio_metrics` are written one row per day a job ran, so a fortnight-old
  install had a fortnight of history and a time axis with a dot on it — while Actual
  had been answering `getAccountBalance` for any date all along and Ghostfolio had
  been answering `range=max` with a dated series. A nightly `backfill` job now reads
  both, at month-end granularity, and fills in what was never asked for.

  The two halves fail independently on purpose. The portfolio-value chart is a
  per-date total, so the chart's value *is* the row and that half always runs. Net
  worth is stored per account, so it needs a value per account rather than a
  portfolio total — and the performance endpoint takes `accounts=<id>`, so each
  Ghostfolio account that actually counts is asked for its own series. One request
  per counted account buys a whole dated history, which makes this N calls for the
  job rather than N per date, and N the accounts that count rather than the accounts
  that exist. The unfiltered total is never split across accounts: on an install
  where Ghostfolio counts seven accounts and one of them is mapped, splitting it
  would overstate history by six accounts every month, in the flattering direction.

  Asking per account is also what lets a month-end predate one holding and not
  another. `range=max` begins at an account's first order, so a month-end before it
  is a month that account held nothing rather than a month whose value is unknown —
  an account opened last year no longer shortens the history of one opened five years
  ago, and Actual alone is the whole truth of a date when there was no portfolio at
  all.

  A date that genuinely cannot be completed — a hole inside a series, or an account
  with no dated value anywhere, which is what a cash-only Ghostfolio account looks
  like — is skipped rather than written and flagged. What the reader gets is a series
  that starts where both halves are known instead of one joined to today at a step,
  and a cliff where a backfill meets live data is worse than a shorter chart, because
  the cliff looks like an event. Nothing has to be cleared later either: the next
  pass still sees the date missing.

  Cost is why it is a separate job. It is the only pass that talks to Actual once per
  account per month, so it reads both date sets before opening a connection and never
  asks Actual again once the net-worth half is complete. It is also left out of the
  freshness banner: every figure it writes is for a settled month-end in the past, so
  its failure leaves the charts shorter and leaves nothing on them wrong.

### Changed

- The net-worth history is clamped to the months Actual actually has a budget for.
  `getAccountBalance` answers a date before the budget existed with zero, and a zero
  that means "there was nothing" renders identically to one that means "we did not
  look" — only one of them is true.
- Jobs that need the current month now derive it from the instant the runner recorded
  rather than reading the clock again, so a run starting seconds before midnight
  cannot write one half of its output into one month and the other half into the next.

## [0.5.12] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Portfolio page** — the value of everything held, the reported time-weighted
  return, an allocation treemap by asset class, and a holdings table of what is
  actually held, largest first
  ([#31](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/31)).
  Annual cost is deliberately not drawn: `ter_annual_cents` has no source yet, and a
  card that always reads "not known yet" teaches a reader that the placeholder means
  nothing.

### Fixed

- **A holding's price is labelled with the currency it is quoted in**, rather than
  with the base currency ([#134](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/134)).
  Ghostfolio converts a position's *value* for us and leaves its *quote* in the
  instrument's own currency, so one row carries two currencies — but the row had one
  `currency` column and the table drew the price with a euro sign regardless. A
  dollar-quoted position was shown as a plausible smaller number, which is worse than
  an error. Prices now carry their own `price_currency`, whatever the provider
  reported, with no currency treated as special; the migration backfills existing
  rows from the value currency, which is what they were rendered with all along.
  No column gains a currency label — under a Belgian format locale `Intl` already
  tells `€ 1.234,56` from `US$ 1.234,56`, so an all-euro portfolio reads exactly as
  it did.

## [0.5.11] — 2026-09-03

### Security
- **Ghostfolio could be written to by anyone who added a line, and only the absence
  of that line was stopping it**
  ([#120](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/120)). The adapter's one request
  helper took `RequestInit`, so `method` and `body` were caller-supplied: every read
  omitted them and got a GET, which made the read-only promise a property of today's
  code rather than of its types. `POST /api/v1/order` and `POST /api/v1/import` are
  real endpoints on the instance Balancr authenticates against, and this is the file
  somebody reaching for "while I'm in here, let me record that transaction" opens.
  Reads now take a `ReadOptions` offering one flag and nothing else, so a write no
  longer compiles; the anonymous-token call — authentication, not a mutation — is
  written out on its own, taking no arguments and hardcoding both its method and its
  path, which also removed the reentrancy where the helper called the token function,
  which called the helper back. A guard test mirrors Actual's: the type protects this
  adapter's callers, and a source scan catches a future file that reaches for `fetch`
  itself.

## [0.5.10] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Copying `.env.example` refused to boot, complaining that a variable left
  deliberately blank was too short**
  ([#118](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/118)). Nine variables ship empty
  in that file and six of them were declared `z.string().min(1).optional()` —
  optional, so absent was fine, but `.min(1)` rejected the empty string the file
  actually supplies. The message read as a rule about length, which invites putting a
  placeholder into a security-relevant slot to get past it. A blank or whitespace-only
  value now means "not set" for those six, via `optionalText()`/`optionalUrl()`
  helpers; required variables still reject an empty string, because a blank
  `ACTUAL_PASSWORD` is a misconfiguration and not booting is the right answer. A test
  reads the real `.env.example`, fills in only what it asks for, and asserts it boots.
- **`ACTUAL_E2E_PASSWORD` failures blamed the wrong thing, or nothing at all**
  ([#119](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/119)). Actual only reads that
  password when the budget carries an `encryptKeyId`, so a blank value on an
  unencrypted budget is a complete configuration and always was. When it *is*
  encrypted, Actual's own error — "File Household is encrypted. Please provide a
  password." — names neither the variable to set nor the file it lives in, and it is a
  different password from `ACTUAL_PASSWORD` two lines above it. `missing-key`,
  `decrypt-failure` and `file-has-new-key` now say `ACTUAL_E2E_PASSWORD` by name and
  keep Actual's wording, which identifies the budget; `old-key-style` points at Actual
  instead, because no configuration change can fix it. Everything else passes through
  untouched — blaming encryption for a wrong sync id would send someone to the wrong
  line of `.env`.
- **Actual's sync engine wrote plain text into an otherwise structured log**
  ([#123](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/123)). Its logger gates progress
  and breadcrumbs behind a `verboseMode` that defaults to on, so every hourly sync put
  ten unparseable lines through `console.log` in the middle of pino's JSON — one of
  them naming the budget file path. `init` is now passed `verbose` tied to
  `LOG_LEVEL`: off at `info`, on at `debug` and `trace`. Quiet rather than silenced,
  because when a budget will not load that chatter is the only view into why.

## [0.5.9] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The settings page — the one screen in the application that writes**
  ([#33](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/33)). Six panels over the eleven
  `/api/settings` routes and the two `/api/ai` ones: language, the thresholds the
  aggregation engine judges by, the prompt editor with its diff and its priced dry run,
  the account mapping that decides which of two tools counts a shared investment
  account, this month's AI spend, and the build in front of you.
- Every settings write answers with the **whole settings payload** rather than the row
  it changed, so the page is a projection of the server's state and never a local copy
  patched to match — a rejected field ends up beside the field that was rejected, and a
  refused write leaves nothing half-applied on screen.
- The thresholds form is **rendered from that payload**. `params` and `paramDefaults`
  are the domain schema itself, so a threshold added to `aggregate/params.ts` appears on
  the page with no client edit, its group and label read from the catalogue — and
  `test/unit/web-contract.test.ts` fails if either is missing rather than letting it
  ship untranslated. Only what actually changed is sent.
- A **grouping mark in a whole-number field is handed back to be retyped**, not guessed
  at. `2.000` in a basis-points field is 20% to anyone typing Belgian grouping and
  0,02% to a decimal parser; neither the panel nor the server can tell which was meant,
  and there is no reading worth saving silently. Which fields are whole numbers is read
  from the stored value, so no list here can fall out of step with the aggregator.
- The prompt editor keeps **saving separate from activating**, because activating an
  earlier version *is* the rollback. Its dry run is a real model call on real figures,
  so the button does not appear until the free estimate has priced it, and the estimate
  refusing to price the run (no facts for the month) is shown as the reason rather than
  as a failure.
- A **viewer sees all of it and may change exactly one thing** — their own language.
  Every other control is disabled with the reason next to it, which is the server's own
  rule made visible instead of re-implemented.
- The AI spend panel is **read-only on purpose**: the monthly cap lives in the
  environment, and a cap editable by whoever reached it is not a cap.

## [0.5.8] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **The portfolio job still failed every pass: Ghostfolio moved every identity field
  into `assetProfile`** ([#113](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/113)). The
  diagnostic added in `0.5.7` did exactly what it was written for — it printed the
  keys the holding did have, and `assetProfile` was one of them while `symbol`,
  `isin`, `name`, `currency`, `dataSource` and `assetClass` were all absent. Current
  releases put them one level down; the schema still read them off the holding. They
  are now lifted out of `assetProfile` when the holding does not carry them itself —
  a fallback per field, never an override, the same rule the record key already
  followed.

  `assetClass` is in that list for a sharper reason than the rest. It is what the
  allocation treemap groups by, and reading it from the level Ghostfolio no longer
  uses does not fail — it puts every position in `unknown` and draws one grey block.
  A wrong answer is worse than a refused payload, so it is hoisted with the identity
  rather than left to a default. Verified against a live 2026 instance: two holdings,
  identified by symbol, classed `LIQUIDITY` and `EQUITY`, shares summing to exactly
  10 000 bp.

- **Time-weighted return was permanently null and the value series permanently empty,
  because Ghostfolio moved the performance endpoint to `/api/v2`**
  ([#115](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/115)). `/api/v1/portfolio/performance`
  now 404s. Nothing said so: #113 refused the details call first, so the pass never
  reached this one, and the two defects hid behind a single error. v2 is tried first
  and a 404 falls back to v1, so an instance old enough to lack v2 keeps working and
  a current one stops being silently empty. Only a 404 falls back — a 401 is a bad
  token and a 500 is Ghostfolio in trouble, and retrying either against an older path
  would answer a different question than the one asked.

  The v2 response is a superset, so one schema covers both. On the live instance it
  returns **401 daily points back to 2025-07-29** — which is the history
  [#114](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/114) is about, and part of why the
  net-worth chart draws a single dot.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **The portfolio job failed every pass on a Ghostfolio release whose holdings do not
  name themselves** ([#107](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/107)). The
  symbol is the key of the map the holdings arrive in, not a field inside them — and
  the code that flattened the map to a list dropped the key, then reported `symbol`
  as missing. So a required field was reported absent by the same function that had
  just discarded the only copy of it. The key is now folded in as the symbol, an
  object that names itself keeps its own value, and the requirement moved from
  `symbol` to the weaker thing that actually has to hold: an ISIN *or* a symbol.

  A position with neither refuses the whole payload rather than being skipped.
  `totalValueCents` is the sum of the holdings that were stored, so dropping one row
  would quietly shrink the portfolio total and every allocation share derived from
  it — a wrong number where the adapter promises a loud failure.

  `currency` became optional in the same pass. Every stored amount is already in the
  base currency, which is what the row is labelled with, so the field was required
  and then never read — and on a live instance it failed every pass over a label no
  code would have looked at.
- **The envelope-budget warning fired on envelope budgets**
  ([#108](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/108)). Actual renamed its budget
  styles: `rollover` became `envelope`, and `report` became `tracking`. The check
  tested only the old name, so it warned about carryover figures on exactly the
  configuration those figures assume — and would have stayed quiet on `tracking`,
  the case it exists for. Both envelope spellings are accepted, because a deployment
  running an older Actual still reports `rollover`. No figure was ever affected:
  `budgetType` is read nowhere else. A warning that cries wolf on a correct setup
  teaches the reader to skip the one that isn't a false alarm, which is the cost.
- **An OIDC redirect URI mismatch could not be diagnosed**
  ([#110](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/110)). The value is derived from
  `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` rather than configured — deliberately, since reading it from a
  `Host` header would let a request choose where the authorization code is sent — and
  the provider compares it byte for byte. It was also the one value nothing printed,
  and the provider refuses the authorization request before the browser ever returns,
  so there was no failed login for Balancr to log and no message for it to improve.
  Startup now logs the issuer, the client id and the exact redirect URI it will send.

  Found while fixing it: `configSummary` — the function whose entire purpose is to be
  loggable, naming every variable and masking every secret — was exported and never
  called, so `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` had never been printed either and the only way to read
  the effective configuration was `docker compose exec … printenv`. It is now logged
  once at startup, right after the version, and gains the two non-secret OIDC inputs
  instead of a single `oidcEnabled` boolean. What makes that safe is a test: every
  secret-shaped field is asserted masked, and no secret value may appear anywhere in
  the object.

### Added
- **The Authentik provider setup is documented**
  ([#109](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/109)): which three values come
  off the provider page, the redirect URI to register with a worked example and its
  Strict matching mode, why it is derived rather than configured, what the resulting
  error looks like when it does not match, and the scopes with the reason
  `offline_access` is not among them.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **The logs did not say which build was running**
  ([#104](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/104)). A container answering
  `"version":"0.5.0"` had in fact been pulled at `0.5.4`; the image was pulled and
  the container was never recreated. Establishing that took matching the digest
  `docker compose pull` printed against manifest digests read out of workflow logs,
  because no startup line named a version — and until it was established, two
  already-released fixes looked like fixes that had not worked.

  Startup now logs `version`, `revision`, `node` and `env` as its first line, before
  any step that can fail, since a crash during startup is exactly when the build
  matters most.

### Added
- **The commit is stamped into the image** as `BALANCR_REVISION`, a build argument
  set from `github.sha` and logged as `revision`. The version alone cannot identify a
  build: every push to `main` publishes `edge` from the same `package.json` as the
  last tag, so `0.5.4` names the release and every `edge` build after it. A digest
  now maps back to a commit without reading CI logs. `null` outside an image, where
  the working tree is the answer.

  The name has to be spelled identically in three files — `version.ts` reads it, the
  `Dockerfile` declares it, `release.yml` passes it — and renaming any one of them
  would make the field `null` in every log line forever, with nothing failing and
  nothing warning. `test/unit/server-version.test.ts` asserts the agreement.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The budget page** (`web/src/pages/Budget.tsx`,
  [#30](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/30)) — one month over one request to
  `GET /api/budget`, answered in the order someone actually asks: four totals, then where
  the money went, then whether each envelope held, then whether the month is on pace, then
  a year of shape per envelope. Each answer narrower than the one before it, which is also
  why the charts sit in that order — nobody wants a wall of sparklines before they know
  whether the month balanced.
- **Income to envelopes as a Sankey** (`web/src/charts/SpendSankey.tsx`). Three columns —
  income sources, a pooled hub, envelopes — rather than income drawn straight to
  categories, because that second shape claims to know which euro bought the groceries and
  nothing in Actual knows that. It draws no total it was not handed: the pool's inflow is
  the sum of the income categories rather than `totals.incomeCents`, no negative flow gets
  a ribbon, and a "not spent" node appears only when the pool really has money left.
  Duplicate names are disambiguated, because a link addresses its endpoints by name while
  Actual scopes names to a group, so two envelopes really can share one.
- **Assigned against spent as a bullet chart** (`web/src/charts/BudgetBullet.tsx`) —
  assignment as a wide bar, spend as a narrow bar laid over it, the twelve-month norm as a
  tick. Rows are ordered by the further of the two figures rather than by spend, so an
  envelope holding €400 with nothing spent still appears: that it is untouched is an answer
  to "budget versus actual", not a reason to leave it out.
- **Spending pace against the month's own progress** (`web/src/ui/PaceBar.tsx`), in CSS
  rather than a twelfth chart instance — twelve observers, twelve SVG trees and twelve
  tooltips would cost more than the rest of the page put together for a shape a rectangle
  draws exactly. Every figure it prints — spent, assigned, projected month end, projected
  overrun, how far through the month today is — comes from the server's `burn_rate_over`
  finding. The only arithmetic in the browser is the width of the bar, and a width prints
  no number.
- **A wall of small multiples** (`web/src/charts/CategoryTrend.tsx`), each sparkline
  carrying its own category's EWMA norm dashed through it — which is why the trend window
  is twelve months rather than the twenty-four the history chart uses: the line and the
  average then describe the same period, where two years of line against a one-year mean
  invites reading the gap as a trend.
- **Trailing per-category spend on the wire** (`loadCategoryTrends` in
  `src/domain/aggregate/facts.ts`). Twelve months per category, dense, and every series
  aligned to the same months — dense because a line with holes in it makes a different
  claim from one that touches zero, and shared because a per-category window would hand the
  newest envelope the shortest axis and make its line look the steepest.

### Changed
- **Each sparkline scales to itself**, against the usual shared-axis rule, and the argument
  is written into the file. Rent is thirty times groceries, so one shared maximum draws ten
  flat lines and a single real chart. Magnitude is what the bullet chart one card above is
  for, and every sparkline prints its own figure, so height is never the thing being read.
- **Findings are rendered in the browser from the catalogue the digest already uses**
  (`web/src/ai/signals.ts` over a new dependency-free `src/domain/ai/vars.ts`).
  `/api/budget` carries a finding as a code, a severity and a map of integers — never prose
  — so the same finding reads identically in an email and on screen, and a third language
  costs a catalogue rather than a model call. A code this bundle has no sentence for is
  dropped rather than printed as its own name, and a sentence missing one of its figures is
  dropped rather than interpolated with a hole in it: `€ 0` standing in for "the server did
  not say" is a number someone would act on.
- **The month is a query parameter, not a route.** `?month=` on the endpoint and one piece
  of state in the page, because the resource hook already refetches on a path change and
  that is the whole mechanism. The picker lists the months the database actually holds
  rather than a window derived from the one on screen — a trailing window would drop August
  out of the list the moment July was picked.
- **The browser bundle passes Vite's 500 kB warning**, at 913 kB and 303 kB gzipped: this
  page registers the Sankey, scatter and markLine renderers on top of what the overview
  already pulled in. It is still one file served from Balancr with no external origin and
  nothing inline, which is the property the build actually enforces. Splitting it is worth
  doing once the last screen has added the last chart type, and not before — the set is
  still growing.
- The stale `## [Unreleased]` heading this file carried between 0.5.2 and 0.5.1 is gone. It
  was the section 0.5.2 was rewritten from, left in place by the release that superseded
  it, and it made the overview screen appear twice in a file whose first line promises
  newest first.

### Fixed
- **Every genuine `alert` made `/api/budget` and `/api/insights` answer 500.**
  `signalSchema.severity` said `z.enum(['info', 'warn', 'critical'])` while `codes.ts`,
  `SEVERITY_RANK`, `capSeverity` and both `severity` columns say `alert`. Nothing
  translated between the two vocabularies, so the response schema rejected the value the
  database had just handed it and `parse` threw. Only the two mildest severities were
  reachable: `over_available`, `above_baseline` past its second threshold,
  `emergency_fund_short` and `recompute_mismatch` would each have taken both endpoints
  down. The wire now uses the database's word, and the API fixture carries an `alert` so
  the top severity is exercised from here on — reverting the one-line fix now fails twelve
  tests across both endpoints. Found while building this page's own fixture, which is the
  argument for fixtures that span a vocabulary instead of sampling the middle of it.

### Security
- **Names are escaped on their way into a chart tooltip** (`web/src/charts/tooltip.ts`).
  ECharts renders a tooltip formatter's return value as HTML, and the names going into one
  arrived from a bank feed. The CSP already stops the damage — it permits no external
  origin and carries no `'unsafe-inline'`, so an injected handler never runs — and this is
  the layer that stops the *display* from breaking, which is the failure a good CSP leaves
  behind: a category called `Rent <shared>` should print its own name rather than lose half
  of it to a tag nobody wrote.

## [0.5.4] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **Every AI analysis call was rejected before the model ever saw it**
  ([#96](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/96)). Gemini answered
  `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` to the structured findings pass while the free-text
  narrative in the same run succeeded, so each nightly run recorded
  `analysisStatus: error`, fell back to deterministic findings with nothing ranking
  them, and still billed for the narrative. Two independent causes, both in the
  response schema:

  Zod emits correct draft-7, and correct draft-7 includes four keywords Gemini's
  `responseJsonSchema` does not accept — `$schema`, `default`, `minLength`,
  `maxLength`. The schema is now narrowed to the keywords the provider documents,
  by allowlist rather than by removing those four, since the rejection names no
  keyword and a Zod upgrade emitting a fifth would present as "the AI stopped
  working".

  That alone did not fix it. `maxItems: 48` on the findings array is *also*
  refused — a keyword Gemini accepts, but array bounds are multiplied into an
  undocumented complexity budget, and 48 on a four-field item is over it while 24
  is not. Any cap chosen here would be a guess a single new finding code could
  invalidate, so array bounds are no longer sent at all: the wire schema now
  carries shape and vocabulary, `analysisInstruction` states the limits in words,
  and `parseAnalysisResponse` keeps enforcing them on the way back in. Exceeding
  one now costs a re-rank instead of the whole run.

  Confirmed against the live API, not only against the documented subset: the
  schema as it was is a 400 on both `gemini-3.7-flash` and `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`,
  and the schema as it now stands returns grounded findings on both.

### Changed
- **A rejected structured call now says the schema is the likely cause.** Gemini
  returns a bare 400 with no keyword and no field path, which reads exactly like a
  bad key or a missing model — the reason #96 took an evening rather than an hour.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **Ghostfolio sends `holdings` two ways, and both are now read**
  ([#95](https://github.com/nrosier/balancr/issues/95)). `/api/v1/portfolio/details`
  returns a symbol-keyed map on the releases the adapter was written against and a plain
  list on current ones; only the map was accepted, so the portfolio job failed on every
  run against a live server and no holdings, allocation or TWR were ever stored. Both
  shapes are normalised to a list at the Zod boundary, which keeps the difference inside
  the one file that exists to absorb a Ghostfolio change. Net worth was never affected —
  it reads `/api/v1/account`.
- **The adapter still names the field that moved.** The container is normalised before
  the items are validated, rather than unioning two validated shapes, so a genuinely
  changed holding reports as `holdings[0].quantity` instead of collapsing into "invalid
  union" — the diagnosis is the whole reason the job fails loudly instead of storing a
  guess. The test that used to assert an array *must* be rejected was the origin of the
  bug and now asserts the opposite.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The overview screen** (`web/src/pages/Overview.tsx`) — net worth with its liquid,
  invested and debt parts, the savings rate for the month with the income, spend and
  assigned figures behind it, how many months the emergency buffer covers, the net-worth
  line over time, and the data-quality score with each deduction that is costing it
  points. One request to `GET /api/overview`, and **nothing on the page is computed in the
  browser**: the single piece of arithmetic is turning centimonths of cover back into
  months, because everything else was already decided by the aggregation jobs and a second
  implementation in the client is a second answer.
- **Four states for one endpoint, shared by every page still to come**
  (`web/src/ui/DataState.tsx`, `web/src/api/resource.tsx`). Waiting announces itself in a
  live region rather than flashing a spinner; unreachable says so and quotes the request
  id, which is the only way to find the cause in the log; answered-with-nothing offers a
  refresh instead of a page of zeroes; and a refresh that *fails* keeps the figures it
  already had with a note above them, because throwing away good numbers to show an error
  is a net loss of information.
- **A missing figure says so.** Every field on the overview payload can legitimately be
  null — the net-worth job has run but the budget sync has not, the buffer needs both —
  and each renders "Not known yet" rather than `€ 0`. A zero is a wrong number; a blank is
  a missing one, and only one of the two is honest.
- **A vanished session is reported, not absorbed** (`SessionExpiryProvider`). A cookie can
  be revoked from another device while a dashboard sits open, so a `401` from any endpoint
  is handed up to the session gate in `App.tsx`, which re-asks the server and lands on the
  sign-in screen by exactly the path a first visit takes. Wired once around the whole
  shell, so the four remaining screens inherit it.
- **Freshness told plainly** (`web/src/ui/Freshness.tsx`). A failed job names itself and
  what it said; a deployment with the scheduler switched off explains why the figures are
  not moving; an ordinary instance gets a quiet "Updated 02/09/2026, 07:30"; and a new
  install with nothing to report says nothing at all, because a notice about "not yet" is
  a worry manufactured out of an empty database. A failed **AI** run does not claim the
  numbers are stale — it is not one of the four jobs that produce them.
- `formatDateTime` in `src/i18n/format.ts`, for the one place an hour matters. "Updated
  02/09/2026" for a sync that stopped at midnight reads as this morning's figure.

### Changed
- The overview section is no longer a placeholder, so `common.page.overview.soon` is gone
  from both catalogues and `web/test/pages.test.tsx` checks the "coming next" note on the
  four sections that still have one.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The shell the screens go in** (`web/`) — a Vite + React SPA with routing, navigation,
  a light/dark theme, both languages, the sign-in screen and the chart wrapper every view
  will use. The five sections are placeholders that name what is coming; each is filled in
  its own slice. What is finished is everything a screen needs to exist inside.
- **No external origin, enforced by the build.** `src/server/security.ts` sends a CSP that
  names no outside host and permits nothing inline, so a webfont from Google, a chart
  library from a CDN or a bootstrap `<script>` would not merely be a privacy question — it
  would silently not run. Inter ships as two `woff2` files through `@fontsource-variable`,
  the icons are hand-written SVG components, and `scripts/check-web-assets.mjs` fails the
  build if any emitted file references an absolute URL or carries an inline `<style>` or
  `<script>`. A comment in `web/index.html` says why, so the next person to want a CDN
  finds the reason before the failure.
- **Design tokens in one place, generated into CSS** (`web/src/theme/tokens.ts` →
  `tokens.css`). Colours, spacing, radii and type scale are declared once in TypeScript,
  because the ECharts option objects need the same palette the stylesheet uses and two
  hand-kept copies of a colour drift the first time one is adjusted. The CSS is committed
  rather than built, so the dev server, the tests and the bundle all read the same values
  at first paint; `test/unit/web-tokens.test.ts` fails if the two disagree, which turns
  forgetting `npm run tokens:write` into a failing test instead of a wrong colour.
- **A theme with three states, not two.** Light, dark, and *follow the system* — and
  `system` **removes** the `data-theme` attribute rather than writing the currently
  resolved colour into it, which is the difference between a preference and a snapshot: a
  laptop that switches to dark at sunset should follow, and a stored `"dark"` from last
  night would not. The choice is remembered in `localStorage`, every access wrapped
  because storage can be unavailable, and a junk stored value falls back rather than
  throwing.
- **Charts that dispose themselves** (`web/src/charts/Chart.tsx`). ECharts is registered by
  hand from `echarts/core` — only the pieces used, with the SVG renderer — so the bundle
  carries no chart type no view draws. Each instance is disposed on unmount and rebuilt
  only when the theme changes; a data change updates the existing one. Every chart also
  carries `role="img"` and a text summary of what it shows, because a chart is the one
  component whose meaning is entirely visual.
- **A sign-in screen that decides nothing.** Which methods to offer comes from
  `/auth/session`: `local` is a judgement about the TCP peer address that a browser cannot
  make, so the password form appears only when the server says it would be entertained,
  and "no method available from this network" is a state the screen states plainly rather
  than an empty card. A refused login shows the server's single message verbatim — the API
  deliberately answers every failure the same way, since distinguishing "no such account"
  from "wrong password" confirms a guess for whoever is guessing.
- **The session is asked for, never inferred.** After a successful local login the client
  re-asks `/auth/session` instead of trusting the login response, so the signed-in state
  always comes from the cookie the browser actually holds. Asserted by a test on the exact
  request sequence.
- **The SPA fallback, matching the server's** — an unknown path renders "Page not found"
  *inside* the shell, with the navigation still there, because `src/server/spa.ts` hands
  every navigation the same `index.html` and the two have to agree about what happens next.
- **100 browser tests** (`web/test/`, jsdom) alongside the 979 server ones, in a second
  vitest project with its own setup and its own TypeScript program. They cover the
  properties that are invisible when broken: a modified click stays a browser click and
  never a route change, the back button works, a chart disposes, `system` theme leaves no
  attribute behind, and `t('time.monthCount', { count: 2.4 })` is `2,4 months` in English
  and `2,4 maanden` in Dutch — one catalogue, one formatter, two independent settings.
  The catalogues are the server's own JSON files rather than a copy, which is what makes
  `npm run i18n:check` cover what the browser renders.

### Changed
- `npm run typecheck` now checks two programs, the server's and the browser's; `npm test`
  runs both projects; `npm run build` emits the bundle into `dist/web` and the server
  serves it from there, so a deployment still has one port and no CORS.
- `GET /` and an unknown path answer differently depending on whether a bundle is present.
  Server tests pass `web: null` explicitly, so their behaviour does not depend on whether
  `npm run build` happened to have been run.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The read-only API the views read from** — `GET /api/overview`, `/api/budget`,
  `/api/portfolio` and `/api/insights` (`src/server/routes/api/`). One rule holds the
  directory together: **a request never calls an upstream.** Everything served comes out
  of Balancr's own SQLite, written by a job on a schedule, which buys three things —
  a page load cannot be slow because Ghostfolio's price provider is slow, cannot fail
  because Actual is mid-restart, and opening the insights page cannot spend money. That
  last one is why the AI budget is a limit rather than a hope. The rule is enforced by a
  test that scans the directory for adapter imports rather than by everyone remembering it.
- **`freshness` on every response, as a field rather than a banner.** The cost of serving
  from a cache is that what is served can be out of date, and a stale figure presented as
  current is worse than no figure. So every payload carries the age of the data and the
  state of the jobs behind it. `stale` is deliberately about *failure*, not age: a second
  instance with `JOBS_ENABLED=false` has old data and nothing wrong with it, while a job
  whose last attempt errored is a different matter. `asOf` is the **oldest** success among
  the data jobs, because a fresh portfolio next to a two-day-old budget is two days old.
  The AI job is excluded from both — a rate-limited Gemini call does not make the budget
  numbers untrustworthy, and marking the whole dashboard stale for it would train the
  reader to ignore the flag.
- **Response schemas whose real job is the money** (`api/schemas.ts`). Validating one's own
  output looks like belt and braces, and for a shape mismatch it would be. What `cents()`
  actually guards is the integer invariant: one division, one average, one `* 0.5` in a
  future aggregate turns `1234` into `1234.5`, which renders as `€ 12.345` and is wrong by
  an order of magnitude in a way no test of that aggregate would notice. The parse sits at
  the last point where the value is still Balancr's problem, and a test walks every field of
  every response asserting `Number.isInteger`.
- **Nulls where a figure has not been computed, never zeros.** A fresh deployment has run no
  jobs, and the honest answer to "what is my net worth" before the first sync is "not known
  yet". Zero is a number someone would act on. Same reasoning behind `mwrBp` being absent
  from `/api/portfolio` rather than reported as `0` until the deferred work lands, and
  behind months-of-cover answering `null` when there is no spend to divide by.
- **Months of liquid cover in hundredths of a month** (`emergencyFundCentimonths`),
  averaged over a twelve-month window rather than read off the latest month — a holiday or
  an annual insurance premium would otherwise halve the figure and read as an emergency.
  Hundredths for the same reason as everything else here: the client formats `450` as
  `4,5`, and no arithmetic anywhere is trusted with a fraction.
- **Findings returned as codes and integers, on both the budget and insights endpoints.**
  The client renders them through the i18n catalogue, which is why these endpoints have no
  opinion about language, why a finding cannot end up half-translated, and why adding a
  language costs a catalogue rather than another model call. The two exceptions are
  deliberate and documented in place: the monthly narrative is free prose by design and is
  cached per locale, and the clarification and proposal cards are rendered from the local
  catalogue — where the real category names live, which is precisely why the model never
  saw them.
- **A malformed `?month=` is a 400, not a fallback** (`resolveMonth`). Answering `2026-13`
  with the latest month's numbers under the label that was asked for would hide a client
  bug behind plausible data. A *valid* month that was never computed is a different case
  and gets the empty state: that is a stale bookmark, not an error worth a red banner.

### Changed
- Every API route is registered without an `auth` opt-out, so the deny-by-default guard
  from `0.4.2` covers them by construction, and they inherit the global rate limit for the
  same reason. Both are asserted through the built app — 401 on each of the four without a
  session — and by a source scan for an `auth: false` or `rateLimit: false` that should
  never appear in that directory.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The break-glass local login** (`src/server/auth/local.ts`, `POST /auth/local/login`),
  for when Authentik itself is what broke. Which means it cannot lean on any of
  Authentik's protections, so it carries its own and they are stricter than an ordinary
  password login would be: both factors always — `local_credentials.totp_secret` is not
  nullable, so a password-only local account cannot exist — one identical message for
  every kind of failure, and an argon2id verification against a decoy hash when the
  address is unknown, because argon2 takes long enough that skipping it would answer
  "is there an account here?" through the response time alone.
- **The gate is the TCP peer address, never `X-Forwarded-For`** (`AUTH_LOCAL_ALLOWED_CIDRS`).
  That distinction is the whole value of the setting: a forwarded header is exactly what
  a request arriving through the public tunnel would set. Which also means Traefik's own
  address must not be inside the range — noted in `.env.example` and the README, and the
  reason `config.ts` already refuses a loopback-only `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` in production.
  Tested by sending `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` from outside the range and asserting it
  changes nothing.
- **A used code is a spent code** (`local_credentials.last_totp_step`, migration `0006`).
  A six-digit code is valid for its whole thirty-second step and for the step either side
  of it once clock skew is allowed for, so a code read off a screen is replayable for up
  to ninety seconds. The highest step already accepted is remembered and anything at or
  below it is refused. Worth closing on this path specifically: it is the one used under
  pressure, on whatever screen is to hand.
- **Lockout after five failures, counted across both factors** (`LOCKOUT_THRESHOLD`,
  fifteen minutes). A wrong code is as much a guess as a wrong password, and a second
  factor that can be retried freely is a formality. Attempts made while the lock is in
  force do not extend it — otherwise a script pointed at the endpoint holds the account
  shut indefinitely, which on the break-glass path is the outage it exists to survive.
  The trade is stated in the module header: someone already inside the allowed range can
  be a nuisance, and the CIDR gate is what keeps that on the LAN.
- **A third rate-limit bucket** (`LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT`, ten attempts per quarter hour per
  address). Fixed rather than configurable, because the knob would only ever be turned
  the wrong way. The per-account lockout is the real defence; this stops one client
  spending the server's argon2 budget across many accounts.
- **`npm run auth:local -- --email you@example.com`** (`scripts/local-user.ts`,
  `src/server/auth/provision.ts`): sets or resets the password and prints the TOTP
  enrolment URI once. A command-line tool rather than a settings screen for a reason that
  is not laziness — the credential exists for when nobody can sign in, so it cannot live
  behind a login, and running it on the host keeps the secret out of an HTTP response a
  reverse proxy might log. A reset mints a *new* TOTP secret, deliberately: an operator
  resetting this because they suspect a leak should not be left with half the compromise
  intact. Provisioning lives in its own module so nothing on the request path can write a
  password hash, which `grep` over `src/server/routes` can prove.
- `GET /auth/session` reports `methods.local` for **this connection** — the feature being
  on *and* the peer being inside the range — so the login screen never draws a form that
  is guaranteed to 404.

### Security
- The endpoint answers **404, not 403**, both when the feature is off and when the peer
  is outside the range. The interesting fact about a break-glass endpoint is that it
  exists; an attacker who learns "there is a password login here, just not for you" has
  learned where to go looking for a foothold. The operator's diagnostic is a `warn` line
  naming the refused address, and the response says nothing.
- `POST` means the ordinary CSRF check applies to it, so the login is not a hole in it.
- The attempted address is not logged. It is the one piece of an attempt that is personal
  data, and an operator diagnosing a failure does not need it — the CIDR gate's own line
  already says where the request came from.
- Setting a local password is **not** a promotion: the role rule matches the OIDC path,
  so only the first account in an empty database owns it. A break-glass account must not
  be a way to mint write access.
- An address matching more than one account is refused rather than guessed at, at both
  provisioning and login. `users.email` is deliberately not unique — the OIDC path needs
  an address to be able to move between subjects — so two matches is a situation for a
  person to resolve, not for a login to pick a row out of.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **Server-side sessions** (`src/server/auth/sessions.ts`, table `sessions`): the cookie
  carries 32 random bytes and nothing else — no claims, no signature. What is stored is
  `sha256(token)`, never the token, because `/data` is backed up nightly and a backup is
  a file that travels; read access to a snapshot of that table should yield no working
  cookie. No salt and no slow KDF, deliberately: the input is 32 uniformly random bytes,
  so there is no dictionary to build. Expiry is renewed only once less than half the
  window remains, which makes an active session effectively permanent and an abandoned
  one expire on schedule, for one write every few days instead of one per request.
- **The OIDC code flow against Authentik** (`src/server/auth/oidc.ts`, `openid-client` 6):
  issuer discovery, PKCE `S256`, `state` and `nonce`, with discovery performed lazily and
  cached only on success — so Authentik booting after Balancr in the same compose stack
  cannot poison logins until a restart. A failed discovery is somebody else's outage and
  answers 503.
- **Logins in flight as a table** (`src/server/auth/login-flow.ts`, table `login_flows`):
  the PKCE verifier, the expected `state` and the expected `nonce` must survive the
  round trip without travelling through the browser, or the protections they provide are
  handed to whoever is being defended against. A row rather than a signed cookie because
  single use is then a `delete` with a checked row count — a captured callback URL fails
  on the second attempt — and because a cookie big enough for all three would be sent on
  every request for the sake of ten seconds of a login.
- **The callback is looked up by cookie, not by the `state` in the URL.** Otherwise an
  attacker starts their own login and hands the victim the resulting link, and the victim
  ends up signed in to the attacker's account, typing their finances into it. The
  victim's browser has no matching flow cookie, so the link is useless on its own.
- **`sub`-keyed user rows** (`src/server/auth/users.ts`): the subject claim is the key,
  not the email address, so an address change keeps the account's history and whoever
  later inherits the old address is not handed it. The first subject through the door
  becomes `owner` and everyone after is `viewer` — a default rather than a flag, because
  the failure it avoids is silent: an Authentik policy widened to a group, and the second
  person holding write access to someone else's money. `locale` and `role`, which Balancr
  owns, survive a login; the display name is refreshed from the provider.
- **A deny-by-default route guard** (`src/server/auth/guard.ts`): the same shape as the
  CSRF hook, for the same reason — a route added in six months is protected because it
  exists, not because someone remembered a list. Opting out is `config: { auth: false }`,
  which is greppable. It runs at `preHandler`, after the rate limiter, so an anonymous
  flood is throttled before it costs a session lookup.
- **Endpoints**: `GET /auth/login`, `GET /auth/callback`, `GET /auth/session` and
  `POST /auth/logout`. The first two exist only when OIDC is configured — a 404 is the
  honest answer for a capability a deployment does not have. Logout is a POST and so
  still carries the CSRF check, and rotates both cookies.
- **A test issuer instead of a mocked library** (`test/helpers/oidc-issuer.ts`): a fake
  Authentik reached through `openid-client`'s `customFetch`, signing real RS256 ID tokens
  with `jose`. Mocking the client would have left the questions worth asking — is PKCE
  actually sent, is `state` actually compared, is a token minted for another application
  refused — answered by construction rather than by the code that ships. All three are
  now tested against the real library, along with replay, a missing flow cookie, a
  disabled account and a failed discovery.

### Security
- **`AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER` must be `https://` in production**, refused at startup rather
  than warned about. Found while writing the signature test: OIDC Core 3.1.3.7 condition
  6 lets a client skip verifying the ID token's signature when the token arrives over a
  direct TLS channel from the token endpoint, and `openid-client` takes that permission.
  So TLS to Authentik *is* what authenticates the claims — over plain `http://` on the
  container network, anything that can answer the token request can name itself as any
  user. There is now a test documenting the library's actual behaviour, so a change in it
  fails loudly instead of quietly making the reasoning wrong.
- **Cookie deletion uses the attributes the cookie was set with** (`clearedCookie`),
  because a mismatch leaves the original in place: a logout would leave the session
  cookie pointing at a deleted row. It works out, since the lookup fails — but "it works
  out" is not what a logout should rest on.
- **A login ends any session already in the browser**, so nothing chosen before
  authentication survives it.
- The production cross-field config rules — the loopback-only `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`
  check, the `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` HTTPS check and the new issuer check — now have tests
  (`test/unit/config-guards.test.ts`). A guard that silently stops firing is worse than
  no guard, because `.env.example` still promises it.

### Fixed
- An unmatched path answered 401 rather than 404 once the guard was deny-by-default:
  `routeOptions.url` is undefined on the way to the not-found handler and there is
  nothing there to protect. It also made every "this deployment has no such endpoint"
  answer a lie, including the 404 that `/auth/login` relies on when OIDC is unconfigured.
- `csrf.ts` declares its own `FastifyContextConfig` field instead of casting
  `routeOptions.config`, so a typo in a route's exemption is a type error.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The HTTP server, as its own module** (`src/server/app.ts`): a factory rather than a
  module-level instance, so a test builds a real app against an in-memory database.
  Registration order is the security order — cookies before the CSRF hook that reads
  them, headers before any route can reply, rate limits before CSRF so a flood of
  tokenless requests is throttled like any other flood. `src/main.ts` keeps the
  lifecycle and hands the HTTP surface off to it.
- **Peer-versus-client address handling** (`src/server/net.ts`): the file that decides
  whether a forwarded header may be believed. `peerAddress` reads the TCP socket,
  which an HTTP client cannot choose; `request.ip` is used for logging and rate
  limiting only. `ipaddr.js` does the matching, so an IPv4 client on a dual-stack
  listener (`::ffff:10.0.0.5`) still matches an IPv4 range instead of silently
  matching nothing. A malformed CIDR is a startup failure naming the entry, never a
  range that quietly matches everything or nothing.
- **Security headers** (`src/server/security.ts`): a content-security policy that
  permits no external origin at all — the same decision as bundling every asset
  locally. `'unsafe-inline'` appears nowhere, `frame-ancestors` and `base-uri` are
  `'none'`, and HSTS is sent only on an HTTPS deployment so a developer's localhost is
  never pinned.
- **Double-submit CSRF** (`src/server/csrf.ts`): sound here because of the `__Host-`
  cookie prefix — a token no sibling host can set is a token an attacker cannot know.
  One token per browser rather than per form, so two tabs and the back button work.
  A route opts out with `config: { csrf: false }`, which is greppable, unlike a route
  someone forgot to add to a list.
- **One error envelope** (`src/server/errors.ts`): `{ error: { code, message, requestId } }`.
  A message reaches the client only when the code chose it; Fastify's default echoes
  the thrown message, and the messages within reach include SQLite constraint text,
  better-sqlite3 paths and internal Actual and Ghostfolio host:port pairs.
- **Two rate-limit buckets** (`src/server/rate-limit.ts`, `RATE_LIMIT_API_PER_MINUTE`
  and `RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_HOUR`): an ordinary per-minute bucket against noise, and a
  small hourly bucket in front of anything that can reach Gemini. The second is a
  spend limit wearing a request limit's clothes — a correctly authenticated caller is
  exactly the expensive one, so Authentik cannot help. Counters live in the new
  `rate_limits` table rather than in memory, because an hourly money limit that resets
  on deploy is not a limit. `/healthz` is exempt: a 429 there reads as a dead container.

### Changed
- `src/main.ts` is now lifecycle only — migrations, prompt seeding, i18n, the port and
  the shutdown order. The Fastify instance it used to build inline moved to
  `server/app.ts`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The clarification queue** (`src/domain/ai/clarify.ts`): the mechanism that turns
  "what is this budget for?" from a question asked every month into knowledge stored
  once. A card carries the model's **guess** for confirm-or-edit rather than an open
  question, because confirming a guess is one click and answering an interrogation is
  a chore — and an unanswered guess costs nothing, since every downstream computation
  already works without it.
- **Two materiality floors, both required**: 2% of the month's spend *and* €50. A
  relative floor alone interrogates you about every envelope in a quiet month; an
  absolute floor alone asks about a €60 line in a €4,000 month. The queue is then
  capped at five open questions, applied *after* sorting by share, so the five you
  see are the five worth answering.
- **Asked once, permanently.** Three of the five question codes write columns whose
  default is indistinguishable from an answer — `expected_frequency` defaults to
  `monthly`, and answering "monthly" would look exactly like never having been asked.
  So "asked once" lives in the queue's own history: `answered` and `dismissed` rows
  are kept for ever, and a dismissal is as final as an answer.
- **An answer writes straight through** (`answerClarification`), because the value is
  the *user's own* words, and it raises `category_meta.confidence` by 20 in the same
  transaction as the audit entry. A model's words never take that path — they go
  through a proposal.
- **Propose-and-apply** (`src/domain/ai/proposals.ts`): nothing the model suggests
  takes effect until someone approves it. The payload is validated twice — once when
  the proposal is stored, and **again at apply time**, because the gap between the two
  can be a version upgrade, and a partial write from a payload nothing understands any
  more is worse than a visible refusal. Handlers live in a closed map, and v1 ships
  only local-effect ones: nothing here can write to Actual.
- **The diff is recomputed when it is applied.** The card shows what *would* change;
  the audit trail records what *did*. If someone set the value by hand in between, the
  trail says the write changed nothing rather than repeating a prediction made weeks
  earlier.
- **A privacy warning on the one change that leaks a name.** Clearing `sensitive`
  starts sending the category name to the AI, so that field is flagged `privacy` in
  the diff and the review card says so in plain language.
- **The audit trail** (`src/domain/audit.ts`, `audit_log`): the record of every change
  a human approved, over the one table whose contents cannot be regenerated from
  Actual or Ghostfolio. Append-only — the absence of an `updateAudit` is the guarantee
  — with **no foreign keys at all**, because an entry whose run id a cascade can blank
  is not an audit trail but a cache of one. It stores field pairs rather than
  sentences, so a change approved during a Dutch session reads correctly in English.
- Applying a proposal deliberately does **not** raise `confidence`: that number
  measures what the user stated themselves, and the approval is already in the trail.
- **The nightly AI pass** (`src/jobs/ai.ts`), last in the job registry and the only
  job that spends money. It exists so that opening a page never triggers a model
  call: the ranked findings, the month's narrative and the clarification queue are
  all written hours earlier and read from SQLite. Local housekeeping — expiring
  stale proposals — runs *before* any call, so it still happens on a night when
  Gemini is unreachable.
- **A budget of zero turns the AI off** rather than capping it nightly: a user who
  set the budget to nothing does not want a `capped` ledger row every 24 hours
  telling them so.
- **The month that just ended is analysed once more, then left alone.** Its final
  days of spend landed after the previous night's run, so the figures it was judged
  on were never its final ones — but re-analysing a closed month every night for
  ever is paying repeatedly for an answer that cannot change. Three catch-up
  nights, read in the configured timezone, and never reaching back from a month
  that is already in the past.
- **A provider fault fails the job; a month-shaped one does not.** A spent budget
  and a month with no facts are states to report in the ops table. A call that
  could not be made, or an answer that could not be grounded, is a broken
  integration — and "no findings for four days" is only visible if that shows up as
  an error.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The analysis runner** (`src/domain/ai/analysis.ts`): the one place the bundle,
  the ranking, the redaction, the prompt, the wire call, the schema, the grounding
  and the ledger are wired together — in the one order that keeps the guarantees.
  Rank *before* redacting, so the model is charged for two dozen findings rather
  than two hundred; check the budget *before* calling; render sentences *after*
  grounding, from the deterministic signal rather than from anything the model
  returned. The model's entire contribution is the order of the list and one
  severity it may lower, which is why a hallucinated finding cannot become a
  sentence: there is no code path from a model response to a rendered figure.
- **A signal the payload cannot explain is not sent.** `redact` gives a signal
  about an unknown category a null label, and null is the household sentinel — so
  a category's numbers would have arrived as a household finding. Those signals are
  filtered out of the payload and kept in the local list, where they are still real
  findings.
- **Every ending is a recorded run, except a month nobody attempted.** Over budget
  writes a `capped` row at zero cost carrying the payload it *would* have sent, so
  the audit view shows what was withheld; a transport failure and an unparseable
  answer write `error` rows, the latter billed for the tokens it spent, because a
  model stuck in a loop must not be free. All three return the deterministic list,
  so the page degrades to real findings in a defensible order rather than to an
  error. A month with no facts records nothing at all — an `error` row for a month
  that has simply not been aggregated yet would be a permanent false failure.
- **Findings are stored as numbers, not sentences** (`ai_findings`): a stored
  sentence would be in one language for good, and re-rendering from the metrics is
  what makes switching language free.
- **The monthly narrative** (`src/domain/ai/narrative.ts`), the one place the model
  writes prose. Cached per `(period, locale)`, so a language toggle cannot quietly
  spend money on the deep model; switching language offers an **explicit translate
  action** that sends a page of text to the fast model instead of a month of facts
  to the expensive one — and gives the reader the same review in their own
  language, not a second opinion about the same month.
- **What is stored is what the model wrote.** Labels stay in `ai_narratives`, and
  the household's own names are substituted on the way to the screen. That is what
  keeps a sensitive category's name out of the row the translate action later sends
  back to Google, and a label whose category has since disappeared renders as "an
  unnamed category" rather than as a bare `c9`.
- **A strict local Markdown renderer** (`src/util/markdown.ts`): no CDN, no
  dependency, and the safety argument is the ordering — every character is escaped
  before any tag is produced, and no branch ever writes an attribute, so
  `ALLOWED_TAGS` is the complete list of what can appear on the page. Link syntax
  collapses to its label, images to their alt text. Substitution happens in the
  Markdown, before rendering, so a category called `<script>` is escaped like any
  other text instead of injected.
- Shared month fixtures (`test/fixtures/month.ts`) built through the real
  persistence functions, so a fixture cannot set up a state the aggregation layer
  could not actually produce.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The Gemini adapter** (`src/adapters/gemini/client.ts`): the only thing that
  puts a payload on the wire, so it is the second half of the privacy review —
  `redact.ts` decides what a payload may contain, this decides that nothing else
  is ever sent. Financial data goes inside a delimited block and the system
  instruction states, in as many words, that the block is data and never
  instructions; a payload containing the fence markers is **refused rather than
  escaped**, because a payload that can close the fence can write instructions
  outside it. The fence contract is composed in code rather than stored with the
  prompt, so a prompt saved without it cannot exist. Provider choice
  (`aistudio` / `vertex`) is a pure exported function, since that decision is
  where the data physically goes.
- **Context caching** for the stable system prompt, with the failure path treated
  as a cost problem rather than a correctness one: a prompt below the provider's
  minimum cacheable size falls back to an inline instruction, and the outcome is
  remembered so a nightly pass does not retry a doomed `caches.create` every run.
  The cache key hashes the prompt text, so an edited prompt is never served from a
  stale cache.
- **A closed response schema** (`src/adapters/gemini/schemas.ts`): the model
  returns codes, labels and severities — never prose and never a number. Two
  layers, because one is not enough. The wire schema restricts `code` to the
  vocabulary, so an invented code is a parse failure; then `groundResponse`
  requires every finding to match a `(code, label)` pair that actually exists in
  the payload's signals, which is what catches the plausible hallucination — a
  *real* code about a *real* category that nothing computed. Dropped items are
  recorded with a reason, so that is visible rather than silent. Severity may be
  lowered by the model and never raised: the threshold that would justify an alert
  lives in `settings`, not in a sentence. A parse failure is an error, never a
  rendered guess.
- **The price table and cost arithmetic** (`src/adapters/gemini/pricing.ts`) in
  integer micro-euros, with dated per-model rates and longest-prefix matching so a
  dated or preview suffix prices as its family and `flash-lite` is never billed as
  `flash`. An unrecognised model is priced at the **most expensive** tier, so the
  guard overstates rather than understates what a call will cost.
- **Versioned prompts** (`src/domain/ai/prompts.ts`): the prompt lives in the
  database because a web app cannot edit `.env`, and it is versioned rather than
  overwritten — every edit is a new row, activation is a flag, and rollback is
  activating an older row, so no edit destroys the text that produced last month's
  output. At most one active version per `(key, locale)` is enforced by a partial
  unique index rather than by remembering to clear the old flag. Resolution steps
  down three levels — the locale's active version, then `DEFAULT_LOCALE`'s, then
  the built-in text — so a Dutch prompt nobody has written yet is served by the
  English one, and a database whose prompt rows were deleted can still produce a
  run. The built-in defaults are seeded at startup, idempotently, so a fresh
  install boots with a prompt that can be read in the UI instead of a hidden
  constant.
- **The run ledger** (`src/domain/ai/runs.ts`): one row per attempt, whether or
  not it reached Google. `payload_json` is exactly what was prepared for the call,
  stored verbatim — the record that makes the privacy claim checkable by opening a
  row rather than by argument. A refused attempt is still a row (`capped` when over
  budget, `blocked` when the call was refused before it went out), carrying the
  payload it would have sent, so a missing answer explains itself instead of just
  being absent. Cost is derived inside the writer from the model and the token
  counts, so no call site can record a call as free by forgetting a field.
- **The cost guard** (`src/domain/ai/budget.ts`) over a new `ai_spend_monthly`
  view: month-to-date spend is summed from the ledger and nowhere else, so there
  is no second counter to drift. Over budget serves the last stored answer with a
  banner and never fails hard; an estimate is checked against what is *left*, not
  just against the total, so a month at 95% cannot start a run costing half the
  budget again. `GEMINI_MONTHLY_BUDGET_EUR=0` reads as "no AI spend at all", since
  that is the one interpretation of a zero budget that cannot produce a bill
  nobody asked for. The view groups by **UTC** month deliberately — SQLite has no
  timezone database, and a fixed offset would be wrong half the year — and the
  guard computes its month key from the same rule.
- **A line diff** (`src/util/diff.ts`) for the prompt editor: LCS over lines,
  deletion-first on a tie, and a hard line cap so a pasted document cannot make the
  editor allocate a table nobody wants.
- Tests for all of it (140 new): the grounding refusals one by one, the fence
  refusal for a marker buried at any depth, the caching fall-back and its
  no-retry memo, thinking tokens billed as output, prompt rollback leaving exactly
  one active row, the three-step resolution, the ledger's verbatim payload, the
  view summing across statuses and grouping by UTC, and every branch of the budget
  decision including the zero budget.

### Changed
- Startup seeds the built-in prompts after migrations and before i18n, so the
  documented startup order still describes what happens.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **The redaction boundary** (`src/domain/ai/redact.ts`): one pure function from
  everything the aggregation layer computed to the exact object that is sent to
  Gemini, and the only path there. Amounts, baselines, deltas, allocation shares
  and category names cross; payees, memos, transaction ids, account names and
  numbers, instrument names, symbols and ISINs never do. Every field is written
  out by hand — no spreads, no `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(x))` — because a spread
  is how a field added upstream rides along with no test failing. Categories and
  accounts are addressed by an opaque label (`c7`, `a2`) assigned in id order, so
  a stored payload still reads against today's data and the stable half of the
  prompt stays cacheable. A category flagged `sensitive` keeps its amounts and
  loses its name and description, so the model can still reason about the money
  without learning it is a therapist.
- **Finding assembly** (`src/domain/ai/findings.ts`): the editor between the
  producers and the page. One signal per code and category, keeping the most
  serious and breaking ties by size so a re-run cannot change the answer; hygiene
  findings first regardless of severity, because "312 transactions are
  uncategorised" is the reason not to trust the alert beneath it; then two per
  category and two dozen in total. Household findings are exempt from the
  per-category cap, since they are each about a different thing. Nothing is
  computed here.
- **Local rendering of every finding** (`src/domain/ai/render.ts`): a code plus
  numbers becomes a sentence from the i18n catalogue, so both languages come for
  free and output can never end up half-translated. One table maps each code's
  metrics to its sentence variables, exhaustive over `FindingCode` by type, and
  every value goes through `src/i18n/format.ts`. An account that was never
  reconciled says so instead of reporting `-1` days.
- `test/unit/ai-redact.test.ts` — the privacy guarantee, and load-bearing. A
  denylist built from the fixture's own account names, source ids, IBANs, ISINs
  and fund names, asserted absent from the serialised payload; a second assertion
  that the fixture really contains them, so the first cannot pass by testing
  nothing; and a key allowlist walked to any depth, which catches the field
  somebody adds later without deciding whether it is safe to send.
- `test/unit/ai-render.test.ts` walks the whole vocabulary in both languages,
  because a finding whose metric keys do not match its producer renders as
  nothing at all, and nobody notices a finding that is missing.
- **The signal orchestrator** (`src/domain/aggregate/signals.ts`): the one place
  that decides which deterministic producers run over a month and in what order,
  and the last purely computational step — everything after it only selects, hides
  or explains what it produced. Output is sorted but uncapped: these rows are
  facts, and capping them here would mean a threshold change rewrote history. The
  trailing window must end at the month being judged, and is asserted dense before
  anything reads a trend off it.
- **Month-level persistence** (`src/domain/aggregate/month-store.ts`): totals, the
  uncategorised backlog and recompute drift, so every pass after the sync reads a
  month from SQLite rather than downloading a budget again. `loadTrailingTotals`
  returns the unbroken run of months ending at the one being judged — a gap can
  exist legitimately, and the honest answer to a hole is a shorter window, not an
  average taken across it. Drift rows are replaced per month rather than derived
  from the mismatches passed in, so a month that has *stopped* drifting is cleared
  instead of showing yesterday's fixed problem forever.
- **Signal persistence** (`src/domain/aggregate/signals-store.ts`): a month's
  findings and its hygiene score, replaced wholesale on every run because a
  finding that has stopped being true has to disappear. The hygiene row is written
  even for a month with nothing to report, which is what lets a later pass tell
  "clean" apart from "not analysed". Reads are defensive: a code dropped from the
  vocabulary in a later version, or a metrics blob that will not parse, drops that
  row rather than making an old month unopenable.
- **The nightly signals job** (`src/jobs/signals.ts`): judges the current month
  and the one before it, so the month that just ended is seen once in its final
  state. Reads SQLite and nothing else, with one documented exception — Actual's
  account list, for `last_reconciled`, because a reconciliation is an event that
  exists only there. Actual stores that column as epoch milliseconds in a text
  field, so `reconciledDate` accepts both shapes and degrades to "never
  reconciled", which overstates the problem rather than hiding it.
- **The analysis collector** (`src/domain/ai/bundle.ts`): everything the model may
  see, gathered out of the fact tables. The counterpart to `redact.ts`, and it
  comes first — a field never collected cannot leak, whatever anyone adds
  downstream. It recomputes nothing: the hygiene score is read, not recalculated,
  and its window comes from the same `loadTrailingTotals` call the signals job
  makes, so the figure the model explains is the figure the page shows. A month
  that has not been judged returns null rather than a bundle of zeroes. Hidden
  categories with no money in them are dropped; hidden categories that saw money
  are kept, because that is worth knowing about.
- `loadFacts`, `loadCategoryMeta` (`src/domain/aggregate/facts.ts`),
  `loadLatestNetWorth` (`networth-store.ts`), `loadPortfolioMetrics` and
  `countSnapshotHoldings` (`src/domain/portfolio/store.ts`) — the read side the
  collector and the signals job need. The category name comes from
  `category_meta`, stored once, so a rename in Actual relabels every historical
  month at the same time.
- Four tables and six columns: `monthly_totals`, `recompute_mismatches`,
  `monthly_signals`, `monthly_hygiene`, and the baseline companion columns on
  `monthly_category_facts` (migration `0001_young_domino.sql`).
  `monthly_signals.subject_key` holds `''` rather than NULL for a household-level
  signal, because SQLite treats NULLs as distinct in a unique index and two
  household signals of one code would both be stored.
- `test/unit/ai-bundle.test.ts`, `month-store.test.ts`, `signals-store.test.ts`
  and `signals-orchestrator.test.ts` — 66 tests, including an end-to-end pass that
  builds a bundle out of the database, runs it through the real redaction
  boundary, and asserts both the key allowlist and the absence of every name that
  was in the tables.

### Changed
- `signalMagnitude` is exported from `src/domain/aggregate/overspend.ts`. The
  ranking breaks ties the same way the sort does, and two definitions of "which of
  these matters more" that can disagree would put the caps and the order out of
  step.
- `emergency_fund_short` reports `targetMonthsBp` rather than `targetBp`.
  `savings_rate_low` already had a `targetBp` measured in basis points of income,
  and one metric name whose unit depends on which code carries it is how a chart
  eventually prints "3 months" as "0,3%".
- Renovate proposes version bumps, never digests. A `uses: actions/checkout@abc123`
  diff cannot be reviewed — a patch bump and a hijacked tag read identically — so
  `pinDigests` is off explicitly, in case a preset turns it on.
- `BundlePortfolio` carries `holdingCount: number` instead of the holdings
  themselves, and the collector never puts a holding in a bundle at all. Which
  funds someone owns is the most identifying data in the set, so it is excluded a
  layer earlier than the redaction boundary: there is then no instrument name for
  a future field to carry out by accident, and asset-class shares plus a count say
  everything that can usefully be said about the shape of a portfolio. The
  privacy claim is structural rather than a matter of remembering to strip a
  field.
- `NetWorthSummary` and the `LIQUID` kind set are exported from
  `src/domain/aggregate/networth.ts`, so the stored snapshot can be summed back
  into the same summary shape the live computation produces. One authority per
  figure: the signals job reads the snapshot the net-worth pass wrote earlier in
  the same queue rather than recomputing net worth itself.
- `unreconciled_account` carries the account id as its subject. With a null
  subject two stale accounts landed in the household group, deduped into one
  finding, and left the redaction boundary with no id to turn into a label.
- The Docker build moved out of `ci.yml` into `image.yml`, and no longer runs on
  every pull request. On a source-only change it re-verified nothing: the image's
  build stage runs the same `npm run build` the `verify` job already ran, and every
  merge to main publishes `edge` from `release.yml` regardless, so the
  pull-request build was a third build of the same artefact. It now triggers on the
  paths that decide how the image is *assembled* — `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`,
  the lockfile, `tsconfig.build.json`, the two build scripts. `package.json` is on
  that list, which makes it the milestone gate too: the version bump that closes a
  milestone builds the image before it merges.
- Slices of an unfinished milestone now release as patches of the current minor.
  A minor keeps its meaning — `0.4.0` will be the version where the AI-layer
  milestone is *complete* — while work merged on the way there still ships under a
  version of its own, instead of sitting on main unreleased for weeks. So this is
  `0.3.1`: the aggregation milestone is what is finished, and two slices of the AI
  layer are on top of it.
- Workflow actions are referenced by version tag rather than by pinned digest, so
  the files match the rule `renovate.json` already states. A `@<40 hex> # v7` diff
  cannot be reviewed — a patch bump and a hijacked tag read identically — and
  Renovate would have kept proposing exactly those diffs.

### Fixed
- The release and licence badges no longer read "repo not found". Both were
  shields.io `github/…` endpoints, which fetch over the *public* GitHub API — on a
  private repository that is a 404, and a badge reading "repo not found" looks
  like a broken project rather than a closed one. Both are now static badges, and
  `npm run badges:check` (in CI) fails if either drifts from `package.json` or if a
  dynamic one is reintroduced. The CI badge is GitHub's own `badge.svg`, which a
  signed-in viewer with access can read, so it stays dynamic.
- Pluralised sentences print a Belgian number. i18next writes an interpolated
  value with `String()`, so `{{count}} months` rendered `2.4 months` in a UI that
  spells every other number `2,4`; `count` now selects the plural form and
  `{{value}}` prints it. The formatting lives in `t()` rather than in
  `interpolation.format`, which looks like the place for it and is not — i18next
  installs its own formatter during `init` and discards the hook. `npm run
  i18n:check` fails a plural key that reaches for `{{count}}` again.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- Month arithmetic utilities (`src/util/month.ts`) — string-based `YYYY-MM`
  handling with timezone-correct month progress for burn-rate projection.
- Tunable aggregation parameters (`src/domain/aggregate/params.ts`) stored in
  `settings`: baseline window and half-life, winsorisation bounds, overspend
  thresholds with an absolute materiality floor, burn-rate tolerance, hygiene
  staleness limits. A malformed stored row degrades to defaults and logs, rather
  than taking the nightly job down.
- Baseline engine (`src/domain/aggregate/baseline.ts`): EWMA with a 3-month
  half-life over winsorised values, and frequency-aware smoothing so an annual
  premium is compared as a rate rather than flagged every year.
- The 53 roadmap issues on GitHub, seeded idempotently by
  `scripts/seed-issues.mjs` so the tracker can be rebuilt from the file.
- **Spend aggregation** (`src/domain/aggregate/spend.ts`): dense facts per
  (month, category), Actual's own figure alongside our AQL sum on one sign
  convention, the uncategorised backlog, and a signed report of any difference
  between the two — a wrong hygiene rule announces itself instead of quietly
  feeding every baseline downstream.
- **Overspend signals** (`src/domain/aggregate/overspend.ts`): the four questions
  kept separate — over assigned, over available, over your own baseline, over the
  external benchmark — plus a mid-month burn-rate projection, good news when a
  category drops below its norm, and `irregular_expense` for a first-ever cost.
  Every relative signal is gated on an absolute floor, because a EUR 7 envelope
  40% over is EUR 2.80.
- **Hygiene signals and score** (`src/domain/aggregate/hygiene.ts`): uncategorised
  backlog, recomputation mismatch, accounts whose balance has become a guess for
  want of reconciling, and portfolio snapshots past their staleness limit. The
  score is an explicit capped-deduction model from 10000 bp rather than a weighted
  average, and reports what it deducted and why, so a number the AI narrates is
  never unexplainable. Snapshot staleness is documented as the age of *our*
  snapshot, because Ghostfolio's API exposes no as-of date for a market price.
- **Net worth** (`src/domain/aggregate/networth.ts`): one figure out of two systems
  that both think they know it. `account_map.dedupe_group` plus
  `is_source_of_truth` stops an Actual investment mirror and the same Ghostfolio
  positions being added together, which would overstate net worth by the size of
  the portfolio — wrong in the flattering direction and entirely plausible. A
  group with no source of truth is reported explicitly rather than silently
  counted as nothing, because too-low net worth has no symptom.
- **Household signals** (`src/domain/aggregate/household.ts`): savings rate against
  target, income moved against its own norm, emergency fund in months of
  *typical* spend, and a new net-worth high. Every ratio with a zero denominator
  produces nothing at all rather than an infinity.
- `daysBetween` and `assertDate` in `src/util/month.ts`, for staleness measured in
  calendar days rather than in instants.
- **Idempotent fact persistence** (`src/domain/aggregate/facts.ts`): upsert rather
  than delete-then-insert, so no page load can catch a month mid-rebuild; stale
  rows for categories that vanished are removed explicitly. `category_meta`
  tracks renames without ever overwriting what the user typed.
- `assertDenseMonths` in `src/util/month.ts`, shared with the baseline engine.
- `recompute_mismatch` finding code — the cross-check had no way to speak.
- `capSeverity`, so the ceiling declared in `FINDING_SPECS` is a rule that applies
  to the model's output and our own signals alike, not documentation.
- `GET /` answers with the version and where the UI will be, instead of a bare
  Fastify 404 that reads as a broken deployment.
- Golden tests throughout: hand-computed EWMA and interpolated quantiles, the
  annual-premium case the frequency window exists to handle, the Brussels midnight
  case where UTC still says the previous month, sign normalisation in both
  directions, the chunk boundary in the writer, each overspend signal proven to
  fire on its own, the dedupe cases that would misstate net worth in either
  direction, and the annual-premium month that must not shorten the emergency
  fund on paper.

- **Account mapping** (`src/domain/aggregate/accounts.ts`): both tools' accounts
  into one table, under one rule — a sync may create rows and follow renames, but
  may never overwrite a decision. Dedupe candidates are only offered where a
  mirror plausibly exists, and marking a group picks exactly one source of truth.
- **Portfolio snapshots and metrics** (`src/domain/portfolio/`): Ghostfolio's
  floats become integer cents exactly once, at the boundary, while quantities stay
  text so a fractional share survives the round trip. Two positions in the same
  ISIN merge into one instrument. Allocation shares are apportioned by largest
  remainder so they sum to exactly 10000 bp — a pie chart labelled 99.97% invites
  the reader to distrust every other figure on the page. Return is *copied* from
  Ghostfolio rather than recomputed, because two implementations that can disagree
  is the problem and not the fix; `mwrBp`, `driftJson` and `terAnnualCents` stay
  null with the missing input named, since a guess would render as a number.
- **Job layer** (`src/jobs/`): `isDue` over `{interval}` and `{daily}` schedules,
  compared on the *local* calendar day and hour, so a DST change can neither skip
  the nightly pass nor run it twice — and no cron dependency. `nextRunAt` probes
  that same predicate forward instead of re-deriving calendar arithmetic that
  would be free to disagree with it.
- Every job shares one queue, because Actual's `dataDir` makes no concurrency
  promises; a job never throws at the ticker, the `jobs` row is written on failure
  too, and `lastSuccessAt` is deliberately left alone so it keeps meaning "how
  stale the data is" rather than "when we last tried". Rows left `running` by a
  killed container become errors at startup — otherwise the one field an operator
  reads is the one nobody believes.
- Three jobs, registered in dependency order because one queue is all the
  sequencing needed: `sync` (read-only Actual pass, facts rebuild, account map),
  `portfolio` (holdings snapshot and metrics, stamped with the *local* date so a
  night-time run cannot overwrite yesterday), and `networth` nightly. A Ghostfolio
  outage degrades each of them to stale-but-labelled data instead of aborting the
  pass, and a failed earlier job still lets the later ones run.
- `historyDepth`: each pass loads `windowMonths + 11` months of budget history
  before the first target month, pinned by a test against `computeBaseline` itself
  rather than against a number — too little history makes every annual baseline
  null, and that failure is completely silent.
- Scheduler wired into startup behind `JOBS_ENABLED`, and stopped before the HTTP
  server on shutdown so a pass in flight is never cut off mid-write.
- `JOBS_ENABLED`, `JOBS_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, `JOBS_NIGHTLY_HOUR` and
  `JOBS_HISTORY_MONTHS` in `.env.example`, with what each one costs.
- `dateIn` and `hourIn` in `src/util/month.ts` — the scheduler's "is it past
  03:00 yet" has to be asked in Brussels, not in UTC.

### Changed
- `BaselineResult` reports `winsorEffectBp` — how far winsorisation moved the
  norm — instead of a `clamped` boolean. Because the quantiles are interpolated,
  the p5/p95 clamp nudges the extremes of every series that is not perfectly
  flat, so the boolean was true for nearly every category and told a reader
  nothing.
- `above_baseline` may now carry `alert`. It was capped at `warn`, which made
  `overspend.baselineAlertBp` a threshold that could not change anything.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Actual Budget adapter.** Sole owner of the sync `dataDir`, with all
  operations serialised because the API makes no concurrency guarantees. Exposes
  reads only — a test scans the module against a denylist of mutating methods, so
  an accidental write is a failing build.
- **ActualQL queries** for accounts, categories, groups, budget months, account
  balances and a recomputed monthly spend used as a cross-check. Every response
  is schema-validated, since `aqlQuery` returns `unknown`.
- **Ghostfolio adapter** with anonymous-token auth, JWT caching, exactly one
  re-authentication on a 401, and a request timeout so a hung upstream cannot
  hang the nightly job.
- **Capability probe** (`npm run probe`) that validates every response shape and
  distinguishes *unreachable* (retry later) from *shape-mismatch* (stop writing
  snapshots — the contract changed). It also reconciles every category total
  against Actual's own figures, which is the acceptance test this app's
  credibility rests on.
- Version alignment check between `@actual-app/api` and the Actual server, warned
  rather than fatal: taking Balancr down on every server upgrade is its own
  failure mode.
- CI (typecheck, i18n parity, tests, image build), gitleaks secret scanning,
  Renovate configuration, Dockerfile and compose stack, README.

### Fixed
- `/healthz` reported `"version": null` inside the container: npm sets
  `npm_package_version` only for processes it starts, and the image runs
  `node dist/main.js`. The version is now read from the shipped `package.json`.
- Replaced Fastify's deprecated top-level `disableRequestLogging` with a
  `LogController` instance — the option is removed in Fastify 6.
- Runtime image carried 27 MB of the TypeScript 7 Go compiler: npm does not mark
  an *optional* dependency of a *dev* dependency as dev, so `--omit=dev` kept it.
  `scripts/prune-runtime-deps.mjs` now drops it along with the native prebuilds
  for platforms this image cannot run.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- Environment configuration validated at import time, with cross-field rules
  reported all at once.
- SQLite schema (Drizzle): identity, source mapping, category knowledge, computed
  facts, AI audit trail, ops.
- i18n with English and Dutch catalogues (209 keys each), generated from one tree
  so parity is structural, and enforced by `npm run i18n:check`.
- Formatting split from language: amounts and dates stay Belgian in every UI
  language, because `Intl` with `en-BE` yields `€1,234.56`.
- Closed AI vocabulary (16 finding codes, 5 clarification codes) with sentences
  rendered locally from the catalogues.
- Logging with a redaction denylist at the sink.
